We sought to identify poor prognostic factors preoperatively and to retrospectively evaluate preoperative clinical indications for surgery.METHODS: A total of 75 patients with colorectal cancer had pulmonary metastases excised from 1986 to 2003. Tumor size, number, laterality, hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and carcinoembryonic antigen level were possible risk factors for metastatic tumors, with primary site of colorectal tumor, disease-free interval, and hepatectomy for liver metastasis possible risk factors for primary tumors. Prognostic factors in univariate and multivariate analyses also included age and sex.RESULTS: Five-year survival rates were 41.3% after pulmonary excision and 73.1% after primary colorectal resection. Three factors identified as significant by univariate log-rank test for overall survival after pulmonary resection were carcinoembryonic antigen (p \u003c 0.0001), tumor laterality (p \u003d 0.0205), and number of pulmonary metastases (p \u003d 0.0028).

In contrast, carcinoembryonic antigen, number of metastases, and disease-free interval predicted prognosis after primary colorectal resection. Prior hepatectomy for metastases did not influence prognosis after pulmonary metastasectomy.CONCLUSIONS: Elevated carcinoembryonic antigen level and multiple metastases are preoperative predictors of poor prognosis after resection of pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer.

In multivariate analysis, age, status of lymph node metastasis at the primary tumour, location of primary tumour, time of appearance of the metastasis, the use of preoperative chemotherapy and the presence of extrahepatic tumour proved to be independent statistically significant predictors for the prognosis.

This national registry study examined prognostic factors for radically treated primary tumours, including the subgroup of patients undergoing liver metastasectomy.METHODS: Patients who had radical resection of primary colorectal cancer in 2009-2013 were identified in a population-based Swedish colorectal registry and cross-checked in a registry of liver tumours. Data on primary tumour and patient characteristics were extracted and prognostic impact was analysed.RESULTS: Radical resection was registered in 20 853 patients; in 38·7 per cent of those registered with liver metastases, surgery or ablation was performed. The age-standardized relative 5-year survival rate after radical resection of colorectal cancer was 80·9 (95 per cent c.i. 80·2 to 81·6) per cent, and the rate after surgery for colorectal liver metastases was 49·6 (46·0 to 53·2) per cent. Multivariable analysis identified lymph node status, multiple sites of metastasis, high ASA grade and postoperative complications after resection of the primary tumour as strong risk factors after primary resection and following subsequent liver resection or ablation. Age, sex and primary tumour location had no prognostic impact on mortality after liver resection.CONCLUSION: Lymph node status and complications have a negative impact on outcome after both primary resection and liver surgery. Older age and female sex were underrepresented in the liver surgical cohort, but these factors did",

Hepatectomy is the gold standard treatment for colorectal liver metastases. For patients who cannot undergo radical resection of liver metastases for various reasons, ablation therapy, interventional therapy, and systemic chemotherapy can be used to improve their quality of life and prolong their survival time.AIM: To explore the prognostic factors and treatments of liver metastases of CRC.METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 87 patients with liver metastases from CRC treated at the Liaoning Cancer Hospital and Institute between January 2005 and March 2011. According to different treatments, the patients were divided into the following four groups: Surgical resection group (36 patients); ablation group (23 patients); intervention group (15 patients); and drug group (13 patients). The clinicopathological data and postoperative survival of the four groups were analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis, and the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for multivariate analysis.RESULTS: The median survival time of the 87 patients was 38.747 ± 3.062 mo, and the 1- and 3-year survival rates were 87.5% and 53.1%, respectively. The Cox proportional hazards model showed that the following factors were independent factors affecting prognosis: The degree of tumor differentiation, the number of metastases, the size of metastases, and whether the metastases are close to great vessels. The results of treatment factor analysis showed that the effect of surgical treatment was better than that of drugs, intervention, or ablation alone, and the median survival time was 48.83 ± 4.36 mo. The drug group had the worst prognosis, with a median survival time of only 13.5 ± 0.7 mo (P \u003c 0.05). For patients with liver metastases of CRC near the great vessels, the median survival time (27.3 mo) of patients undergoing surgical resection was better than that of patients using other treatments (20.6 mo) (P \u003c 0.05).CONCLUSION: Patients with a low degree of primary tumor differentiation, multiple liver metastases (number of tumors \u003e 4), and maximum diameter of liver metastas",

In multivariate analysis, the resection of liver metastases, serum CEA concentration, number and size of liver metastases have been identified as prognostic factors.",
        "The prognosis after liver metastasis resection in colorectal cancer patients can be influenced by several clinical conditions, including the number of hepatic metastases, surgical margin, extra-hepatic disease, CEA level, size and distribution of liver metastases, and type of primary tumor. Patients with fewer metastatic nodules, clear surgical margins, normal CEA levels, smaller and fewer liver metastases, and no extra-hepatic disease tend to have a better prognosis. Additionally, the resection of liver metastases, serum CEA concentration, and number and size of liver metastases have been identified as prognostic factors in multivariate analysis.",
        "Several clinical conditions are associated with the curative resection and prognosis in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer. Surgical resection remains the standard therapy for patients with colorectal liver metastases. Among these conditions, pre- and postoperative management plays a key role. In particular, the current article highlights the importance of liver transplantation in very advanced cases of subacute liver failure due to insufficient functional liver parenchyma and toxicity of chemotherapy. The analysis of the data of patients who underwent total laparoscopic or laparoscopy-assisted simultaneous resection of primary colorectal cancer and liver metastases in a hospital between December 2008 and December 2016 has also been presented to understand the possible benefits and risks of these procedures.",
        "Factors such as preoperative frailty, synchronous disease, having more than four metastases, APRI and TBS scores, being younger than 65, the primary tumor\u0027s location and stage, the number of examined lymph nodes, resection margin adequacy, and the central location of liver metastasis significantly influence prognosis after liver metastasis resection in colorectal cancer patients.",
        "In summary, nine clinical factors influence the prognostic of liver metastasis resection in colorectal cancer patients: age (\u003c65 vs. ≥65 years), lymph node metastases of primary tumor (\u003e3 nodes), number of metastatic tumors (\u003c3 vs. ≥3), maximal tumor dimension (\u003c3 vs. ≥3 cm), presence of extrahepatic tumor, hepatic resection margin (\u003c1 mm), number of liver metastases (≥3 lesions within the liver), preoperative GOT level (≥42 mg/dl), and coexisting medical diseases.",
        "The prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer who undergo liver metastasis resection is influenced by several clinical conditions. In multivariate analysis, a hepatic resection margin \u003c1 mm and the number of hepatic metastases ≥3 are independent factors that negatively impact survival. Other prognostic factors include the presence of more than three lymph node metastases in the primary tumor, more than two liver lesions, and extrahepatic tumor. The timing of liver resection for synchronous metastases does not affect survival. The prognosis after treatment of any recurrence is best after accomplishing a repeated R0 situation, regardless of the location of the recurrence. These factors can help guide care strategies and monitoring for colorectal cancer patients with liver metastasis.",
        "The prognostic after liver metastasis resection in colorectal cancer patients can be influenced by the number of metastases, preoperative CEA level, lymph node metastasis, tumor differentiation, and time to recurrence.",
        "Clinical conditions that influence the prognostic after the liver metastasis resection from colorectal cancer patients include:1. Presence of liver metastasis at the time of initial diagnosis2. Presence of distant metastasis at the time of initial diagnosis3. Presence of liver metastasis at the time of resection4. Presence of distant metastasis at the time of resection5. Presence of liver metastasis in the absence of distant metastasis6. Presence of distant metastasis in the absence of liver metastasis",
        "Clinical conditions that influence the prognostic after the liver metastasis resection from colorectal cancer patients include synchronous liver metastasis and tumor recurrence.",
        "1) Liver metastases originating from the left-sided colorectal cancers have a significantly better prognosis than metastases from right-sided colorectal cancers.\n2) Metachronous liver metastases are associated with a better prognosis than synchronous liver metastases.\n3) The prognosis is worse in patients with extrahepatic metastases, especially when such metastases have a higher Dukes\u0027 grade.\n4) The prognosis in patients with only hepatic metastases is better than that in patients with non-hepatic metastases.",
        "The prognostic of liver metastasis resection in colorectal cancer patients is influenced by several clinical factors: age (\u003c 65 vs. \u003e/\u003d 65 years), lymph node metastases of the primary tumor, number and size of metastatic lesions, presence of extrahepatic tumors, hepatic resection margin width, GOT preoperative level, and coexisting medical diseases.",
        "The prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients after liver metastasis resection is influenced by several clinical conditions. A study using data from the SEER database found that age, number and size of liver metastases, and lymph node status of the primary tumor are important prognostic factors. In a national registry study in Sweden, lymph node status, multiple sites of metastasis, high ASA grade, and postoperative complications after resection of the primary tumor were identified as risk factors for worse survival. Another retrospective analysis of patients treated at the Liaoning Cancer Hospital and Institute in China found that the degree of tumor differentiation, number and size of metastases, and proximity to major vessels are significant prognostic factors. In a study of patients who experienced recurrence following hepatectomy for CRC metastases, shorter time to recurrence, node-positive primary tumor, and more than one site of recurrence were associated with worse outcomes. These studies suggest that a comprehensive assessment of multiple clinical factors is necessary to accurately predict the prognosis of CRC patients after liver metastasis resection.",
        "The prognosis after liver metastasis resection in colorectal cancer patients is influenced by several clinical conditions. The number of hepatic metastases and the surgical margin are the most important prognostic factors. Patients with four or more metastatic nodules in the liver have a poor prognosis. Other prognostic factors include the size of the lesions, the presence of extra-hepatic disease, the time interval between the resection of the primary tumor and the appearance of liver metastases, and the level of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The resection of liver metastases is a favorable prognostic factor. The role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy is still debated.",
        "According to the studies, several clinical conditions influence the prognosis after liver metastasis resection from colorectal cancer patients. These include: , 1. Lymph node status: Positive lymph nodes are associated with poor prognosis., 2. Multiple sites of metastasis: Presence of multiple metastases is a negative prognostic factor., 3. High ASA grade: Patients with high American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grades have a higher risk of mortality., 4. Postoperative complications after primary tumor resection: Complications during primary tumor surgery are associated with poor prognosis., 5. Hepatic resection margin \u003c1 mm: A narrow hepatic resection margin is a negative prognostic factor., 6. Number of hepatic metastases ≥3: Presence of three or more hepatic metastases is associated with poor prognosis., 7. Age \u003e 65 years: Older patients have a higher risk of mortality., 8. Elevated preoperative GOT levels: High glutamine-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) levels are associated with poor",
        "Inadequate resection margin, preoperative frailty, synchronous disease, extrahepatic disease, centrally located liver metastasis, T3 stage, age \u003c 65 years, and APRI are the clinical conditions that influence the prognostic after the liver metastasis resection from colorectal cancer patients.",
        "Based on the provided information, several key clinical factors influence the prognosis after liver metastasis resection in colorectal cancer patients:\n\n1. Number and size of liver metastases: Patients with fewer than 4 metastases and lesions smaller than 4 cm have better prognosis.\n\n2. Resection margins: Clear surgical margins of at least 10 mm are associated with improved survival. \n\n3. Presence of extrahepatic metastases: Metastatic disease confined to the liver has better outcomes than cancer spread to other organs.\n\n4. Preoperative CEA levels: Normal carcinoembryonic antigen levels before surgery are a positive prognostic factor.\n\n5. Timing of metastases: Metachronous metastases appearing more than 2 years after primary colorectal tumor resection have better prognosis than synchronous metastases.\n\n6. Chemotherapy: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy to downsize metastases and adjuvant chemotherapy after resection may improve outcomes, although still debated.\n\n7. Patient health and liver function: The patient must be medically fit to tolerate major liver resection surgery.\n\nIn summary, key prognostic determinants include the number, size, and distribution of metastases, evidence of extrahepatic spread, tumor biology markers like CEA, and the patient\u0027s overall health status and liver function. Optimal outcomes depend on carefully selecting patients with favorable clinical characteristics.",

It is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and there are 2 main subtypes: neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). The prevalence of NF1 is approximately 1 in 3,000 births, while NF2 is less common with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 25,000 births.",
        "Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a group of three distinct genetic conditions affecting the nervous system, characterized by non-cancerous tumors. The prevalence of NF1 is approximately 1 in 3,500, NF2 is approximately 1 in 25,000, and schwannomatosis is approximately 1 in 40,000. NF1 is the most common type of NF and is characterized by café au lait spots, neurofibromas, scoliosis, and headaches. NF2 presents with early-onset hearing loss, cataracts, tinnitus, and muscle atrophy. Schwannomatosis often presents in early adulthood with widespread pain, numbness, or tingling. There is no known prevention or cure, but surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy may be used to manage symptoms.",
        "The prevalence of neurofibromatosis varies by type:\n\nNeurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common, with a birth incidence of about 1 in 2,500 to 1 in 3,000. \n\nNeurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is less common, with an incidence of about 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 33,000 births.\n\nSchwannomatosis is the rarest, with an incidence of about 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 60,000 births.\n\nAll types affect males and females equally across all races and ethnicities.

Additionally, rectal cancers often present at a more advanced stage, making them harder to treat. The proximity of the rectum to otherical200, as well as the distinct venous drainage systems, may also contribute to the development of pulmonary metastases, which are associated with poorer prognosis.

        "Many apparent differences exist in aetiology, genetics, anatomy, and treatment response between colon cancer (CC) and rectal cancer (RC). Obvious differences exist in molecular carcinogenesis, pathology, surgical topography, and procedures, which contribute to the worse prognosis of rectal cancer compared to other colon tumors.",
        "Rectal cancer (RC) has been shown to have worse prognosis compared to other colon tumors due to several factors, including differences in molecular carcinogenesis, pathology, surgical topography and procedures, and multimodal treatment. Rectal cancer is often diagnosed at a later stage, which can contribute to a worse prognosis. Additionally, the rectum has a richer lymphatic network compared to the colon, which can lead to a higher risk of lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, the rectum is in close proximity to other organs, such as the prostate and vagina, which can make surgical resection more challenging and increase the risk of complications. The standard treatment for rectal cancer also differs from that of colon cancer, with rectal cancer often requiring a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. These differences in treatment can also contribute to a worse prognosis for rectal cancer compared to other colon tumors.",
        "Rectal cancer often has a worse prognosis than colon cancer because of its anatomical location and the complexity involved in its surgical treatment. The rectum\u0027s proximity to other organs and structures can make it more challenging to achieve clear surgical margins, which is crucial for reducing the risk of recurrence. Additionally, rectal cancer is more likely to involve local lymph nodes and spread to nearby tissues, further complicating treatment and potentially worsening outcomes",

Additionally, rectal cancer is often diagnosed at a later stage and may be less responsive to certain treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy.",
        "Rectal cancer often has a worse prognosis than other colon tumors due to several factors. Firstly, its anatomical location in the pelvis makes surgical removal more complex and challenging, increasing the risk of incomplete resection and local recurrence. Additionally, rectal cancer is more likely to spread to lymph nodes and distant organs compared to tumors located higher up in the colon. The proximity to other organs and structures also complicates the application of effective radiation therapy and surgical techniques. These factors collectively contribute to the generally poorer outcomes seen in rectal cancer cases compared to other colon cancers.",
        "Rectal cancer has a worse prognosis than other colon tumors due to a combination of factors, including the anatomical location of the tumor, the unique biology of rectal cancer, and the higher incidence of local recurrence. The primary tumor can adhere to adjacent organs, which is associated with a poor prognosis, resulting in a low 9% 5-year survival rate. Rectal cancer is also more likely to recur locally due to the implantation of cancer cells in the surroundings, and the involvement of the rectum and anus can lead to obstructive symptoms, perforation, and fistulae, all of which increase the risk of death. Rectal cancer has also been found to have more mutations in the APC gene and is more likely to have nuclear beta-catenin expression, which is associated with a poor prognosis.",
        "Rectal cancer has worse prognosis than other colon tumors.\n\nRectal cancer is more often diagnosed in its locally advanced stages, making it more difficult to treat and resulting in a worse prognosis. The anatomical proximity of the rectum to pelvic organs can result in tumor invasion into these organs, complicating surgery and decreasing the chance of complete surgical resection. Radiotherapy is a common treatment for rectal cancer, and the proximity of the rectum to other sensitive organs can cause more frequent treatment-related toxicity than in colon cancer, affecting quality of life.\n\nReferences:\n[1] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27120406\n[2] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26968280\n[3]",

        "Rectal cancer often has a worse prognosis than other colon tumors due to its unique molecular carcinogenesis, challenging surgical anatomy, differences in pathological features, and variability in response to multimodal treatments. **PROVE** These factors contribute to the complexity of managing rectal cancer effectively. The anatomical location of the rectum within the pelvis makes surgical resection more difficult compared to other parts of the colon, increasing the risk of incomplete removal and local recurrence. Additionally, rectal cancers may have distinct genetic mutations and molecular profiles that affect their behavior and response to treatment differently than colon cancers located elsewhere. This can influence both treatment strategies and outcomes. Furthermore, achieving clear margins during surgery is critical for prognosis, and this is more challenging in rectal cancer due to its proximity to other organs and structures. Lastly, rectal cancer requires a multidisciplinary approach involving surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy; variations in how these treatments are combined can significantly impact overall outcomes.",

The study did find that complications were more frequent in rectal cancer cases but had a lesser impact on survival outcomes.",
        "Rectal cancer has a worse prognosis than other colon tumors due to several factors. One of the main reasons is the anatomical location of the rectum, which is located in the pelvis, making it more difficult to surgically remove the tumor. Additionally, the rectum is surrounded by other organs and structures, such as the bladder and prostate in men, and the uterus and vagina in women, which can be affected by the cancer or its treatment. Another factor is that rectal cancer is more likely to spread to the lymph nodes and other organs, such as the liver and lungs, than other colon tumors. Additionally, rectal cancer is often diagnosed at a later stage, which can also contribute to a worse prognosis.",

        "Rectal cancer (RC) tends to have a worse prognosis compared to colon cancer (CC) due to several factors. Anatomically, the rectum has a narrower lumen and is surrounded by vital structures, making complete surgical resection more challenging. Additionally, RC is often diagnosed at later stages because symptoms like changes in bowel habits or rectal bleeding can be attributed to benign conditions, leading to delayed presentation. , Molecularly, RC demonstrates distinct carcinogenesis patterns, with a higher prevalence of certain genetic alterations that can negatively impact prognosis. For instance, RC is more likely to harbor KRAS and NRAS mutations, which are associated with poorer outcomes. Furthermore, RC is often treated with radiation therapy, which can increase the risk of late effects such as bowel dysfunction and impaired quality of life, further contributing to worse prognosis. , Lastly, multimodal treatment approaches for RC may differ from CC,",
        "Rectal cancer often presents at a more advanced stage than other colon tumors, which contributes to its worse prognosis. This is because rectal cancers can be asymptomatic for longer periods of time, allowing the disease to progress undetected. Additionally, the anatomical location of the rectum makes it more challenging to access and treat surgically, which can also impact the effectiveness of treatment. Furthermore, there may be differences in the molecular characteristics of rectal cancer compared to other colon cancers, which could affect response to therapy.",
        "Rectal cancer often has a worse prognosis than colon cancer because of its anatomical location, which makes it more challenging to surgically remove completely. Additionally, rectal cancer is closer to other organs and structures, which can lead to a higher risk of the cancer spreading or recurring. The proximity to the anal sphincter and pelvic structures also complicates treatment and can affect both the approach to surgery and the use of radiation therapy",

        "Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a complex and challenging mental health condition characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and emotions. Individuals with BPD often experience intense and fluctuating emotions, impulsivity, and difficulties in regulating their mood. They may also struggle with feelings of emptiness, fear of abandonment, and engage in self-harming behaviors or have suicidal thoughts. BPD affects both men and women, typically emerging in adolescence or early adulthood, and can significantly impact an individual\u0027s quality of life and relationships. The exact cause of BPD is not known, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic, neurobiological, and environmental factors. Treatment for BPD typically involves a combination of psychotherapy, such as dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and medication to manage symptoms."

        "Aberrant activation of the forkhead protein FOXA1 is observed in advanced hormone-related cancers, such as ER+ breast cancer. However, the key mediators of high FOXA1 signaling remain elusive. FOXA1 can act as a pioneer factor for estrogen receptor (ER), dictating its binding location and therefore its transcriptional activity. In ER+ breast cancer, FOXA1 plays a pivotal role from early-stage cancer to drug-resistant and metastatic disease. Due to this key role in mediating ER function, FOXA1 is not only an attractive therapeutic target but could potentially function as a novel biomarker.",
        "The FOXA1 transcription factor plays a crucial role in estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. As a pioneer factor, FOXA1 facilitates chromatin binding and function of lineage-specific and oncogenic transcription factors. Upregulation of FOXA1 promotes enhancer and transcriptional reprogramming in endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells, leading to the activation of prometastatic gene sets and pathways associated with poor clinical outcomes. FOXA1 mutations influence therapeutic responses by altering chromatin state, and high FOXA1 expression is associated with worse outcomes to endocrine therapy. Conversely, co-expression of FOXA1 and FOXP1 is linked to a favorable prognosis in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients. Overall, FOXA1 modulates estrogen signaling, contributing to the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells, and its aberrant expression or mutations may serve as potential indicators for treatment strategies and clinical outcomes.",
        "The FOXA1 transcription factor plays a crucial role in estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. It is a pioneer factor that facilitates the binding of estrogen receptors (ERs) to DNA, thereby modulating the expression of ER-target genes. This interaction is essential for the growth and survival of ER+ breast cancer cells. FOXA1 also cooperates with other transcription factors, such as GATA3, to maintain the luminal epithelial cell phenotype and inhibit the invasion of cancer cells. Moreover, FOXA1 mutations or altered expression have been associated with endocrine therapy resistance in ER+ breast cancer patients. Overall, FOXA1 is a significant player in ER+ breast cancer development and progression, and understanding its role may provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies.",
        "In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, the FOXA1 transcription factor acts as a pioneer factor that facilitates the binding of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) to DNA. FOXA1 binds to condensed chromatin and opens it up, allowing ERα to access its target genes and regulate their transcription. FOXA1 is essential for the transcriptional activity of ERα in ER+ breast cancer cells.\n\nFOXA1 expression is highly correlated with ERα positivity and endocrine signaling in breast cancer. High levels of FOXA1 may identify ER+ breast cancers that undergo rapid reprogramming of ERα signaling, which is associated with poor outcomes and resistance to endocrine therapies like tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors.\n\nIn summary, FOXA1 plays a key role in ER+ breast cancer by enabling ERα-mediated transcription and its expression may serve as a biomarker for aggressive disease and endocrine resistance."

        "EGFR inhibitors can cause skin rash, particularly papulopustular rash, which often requires long-term antibiotic treatment with tetracycline agents such as minocycline and doxycycline. A randomized study found that prophylactic use of oral doxycycline or minocycline reduces the risk and severity of skin rash, improving clinical outcomes. Topical antibiotics and corticosteroids can also be used to treat the rash. A prospective study evaluating a rash treatment algorithm developed at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center has shown positive results. A phase I clinical trial testing the hypothesis that topical therapy with the BRAF inhibitor LUT014 could improve skin toxicities induced by EGFR inhibitors found that it was safe and efficacious in improving rash from EGFR inhibitors.",

        "Based on the provided information, several treatments appear to be effective for managing EGFR inhibitor-induced skin rash:\n\n1. Oral antibiotics like doxycycline and minocycline, used prophylactically, can reduce the risk and severity of skin rash. Tetracycline antibiotics are commonly used for long-term treatment.\n\n2. Topical antibiotics such as clindamycin and topical tetracycline can be used for milder cases.\n\n3. Topical corticosteroids, especially high potency ones, and topical calcineurin inhibitors like tacrolimus and pimecrolimus can help treat rash and eczema symptoms. \n\n4. A topical BRAF inhibitor called LUT014 showed efficacy in improving EGFR inhibitor-induced rash in a phase I trial.\n\n5. Moisturizers can help with skin dryness, and oral antihistamines like cetirizine may relieve itching.\n\nIn summary, a combination of oral antibiotics, topical antibiotics, topical steroids/calcineurin inhibitors, and supportive measures is effective in managing EGFR inhibitor skin toxicity. Prophylactic use of oral tetracyclines is recommended. Novel topical agents targeting the EGFR pathway like LUT014 are also promising.",

One of the purposes of using stents is palliative treatment; further, its advantages over emergency surgery with colostomy include avoidance of colostomy, relief of obstruction, shorter hospitalization, and better quality of life. In addition, stent placement can also be used as a bridge to surgery since the duration of the hospitalization is shorter and postoperative complications, colostomy rates, and mortality rates are lower with elective than with emergency surgery. Although recent studies have reported low complication rates related to colonic stents, complications may still occur, highlighting the importance of good preparation, adequate staffing, backup systems, and informed consent.

Computed tomography (CT) scanning revealed that there was a mass in the descending colon, which led to intestinal obstruction. On admission, a series of therapeutic measures, such as fasting and water deprivation, gastrointestinal decompression, total parenteral nutrition, and octreotide acetate, were taken to improve the obstructive symptoms. At the same time, a self-expandable metal stent was successfully placed across the stenosis, and a biopsy was obtained and diagnosed as adenocarcinoma.

The safety and oncological effect of self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) in these patients remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate its impact on these variables and compare it with that of emergency surgery (ES).METHODS: Descriptive, retrospective and single-centre study, performed between 2008 and 2015, with follow-up until 2017. One hundred eleven patients with diagnosis of left malignant colonic obstruction were included and divided according to the treatment received: stent as bridge to surgery (SBTS group: 39), palliative stent (PS group: 30) and emergency surgery with curative (ECS group: 34) or palliative intent (EPS group: 8). Treatment was decided by the attending surgeon in charge.RESULTS: Technical and clinical general success rates for colorectal SEMS were 95.7% and 91.3%, respectively, with an associated morbimortality of 23.2%, which was higher in the PS group (p \u003d 0.002). The SBTS group presented a higher laparoscopic approach and primary anastomosis (p \u003c 0.001), as well as a lower colostomy rate than the ECS group (12.8% vs. 40%; p \u003d 0.023).

        "Based on the provided information, self-expanding colon stents have two main clinical indications in colorectal cancer patients:\n\n1. As a bridge to surgery: In patients with acute colonic obstruction due to colorectal cancer, stent placement can achieve immediate decompression and allow for bowel preparation before an elective oncologic resection. This is especially beneficial for high-risk surgical patients and those requiring laparoscopic resection.\n\n2. For palliation: In patients with incurable colorectal cancer, stent placement offers effective palliation of malignant colonic obstruction and its associated symptoms. It can improve quality of life when curative treatment is not possible.\n\nThe technical success rate of stent placement is high with a low procedural complication rate when performed by experienced endoscopists. Long-term oncologic outcomes are comparable between patients undergoing stent placement followed by elective resection and those undergoing emergency bowel resection.",

        "It is generally assumed that there is a clear distinction between promoters, which initiate transcription, and enhancers, which control the spatiotemporal expression. However, studies have unexpectedly shown that regulatory elements can have both enhancer and promoter functions.\nFor example, some enhancers (mainly bidirectional) can act as weak promoters, producing overlapping spatiotemporal expression. Conversely, bidirectional promoters often act as strong enhancers, while unidirectional promoters generally cannot.",
        "Enhancers and promoters are cis-regulatory elements in the genome that regulate target gene transcription. While traditionally considered distinct, recent evidence suggests that there is overlap between their functions. Some enhancers, particularly bidirectional ones, can act as weak promoters, producing overlapping spatio-temporal expression. Conversely, some promoters, especially bidirectional ones, can function as strong enhancers. The balance between enhancer and promoter activity is reflected in the levels and directionality of enhancer RNA (eRNA) transcription, which is likely an inherent sequence property of the elements themselves. These observations suggest that enhancers and promoters may lie on a spectrum of transcriptional regulation, rather than being strictly separate entities. However, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms and implications of this relationship.",
        "While enhancers and promoters have distinct canonical functions, there is evidence that enhancers can sometimes act as weak promoters in addition to their primary role of augmenting transcription from target promoters:\n\n- Some enhancers are transcribed, producing enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), before activating their target promoter. This suggests enhancers can directly recruit transcriptional machinery.\n\n- Certain DNA elements have been found to possess both enhancer and promoter activity, blurring the line between the two.\n\n- Enhancers and promoters share some features like transcription factor binding, open chromatin, and transcriptional activity.\n\nSo while enhancers mainly serve to boost transcription from promoters, they can occasionally act as weak promoters themselves. The boundary between enhancers and promoters is not always clear cut, with some overlap in their functions and characteristics. However, their primary roles remain distinct, with promoters directly initiating transcription and enhancers mainly augmenting promoter activity."

Telephonic interviews were conducted for survival details for some patients who had not reported. Survival analysis was done using the Kaplan-Meier analysis, comparisons were done using log-rank test and multivariate analysis was conducted using the Cox proportional hazard model to find different variables (site, age, sex, stage and treatment) affecting overall survival (OS)/disease-free survival (DFS). Two-year and 5-year DFS for OSCC were observed to be 72.3% and 58.3% with mean survival of 63.17 months (95% CI: 58.342-68.002). Similarly, OS at 2 years and 5 years were 84.3% and 55.9% with mean survival of 65.143 months (95% CI: 60.143-69.601). Tumour site, patient age, stage of disease and treatment modality had a statistically significant hazardous effect on the overall and disease-free survival rates.

The lack of available diagnostics to discriminate viral and bacterial etiologies contributes to this discordance. Recent efforts have focused on the host response as a source for novel diagnostic targets although none have explored the ability of host-derived microRNAs (miRNA) to discriminate between these etiologies. Methods: In this study, we compared host-derived miRNAs and mRNAs from human H3N2 influenza challenge subjects to those from patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia. Sparse logistic regression models were used to generate miRNA signatures diagnostic of ARI etiologies. Generalized linear modeling of mRNAs to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes allowed analysis of potential miRNA:mRNA relationships. High likelihood miRNA:mRNA interactions were examined using binding target prediction and negative correlation to further explore potential changes in pathway regulation in response to infection. Results: The resultant miRNA signatures were highly accurate in discriminating ARI etiologies. Mean accuracy was 100% [88.8-100; 95% Confidence Interval (CI)] in discriminating the healthy state from S. pneumoniae pneumonia and 91.3% (72.0-98.9; 95% CI) in discriminating S. pneumoniae pneumonia from influenza infection. Subsequent differential mRNA gene expression analysis revealed alterations in regulatory networks consistent with known biology including immune cell activation and host response to viral infection. Negative correlation network analysis of miRNA:mRNA interactions revealed connections to pathways with known immunobiology such as interferon regulation and MAP kinase signaling. Conclusion: We have developed novel human host-response miRNA signatures for bacterial",

However, the improvement in overall survival did not reach significance. The study also reported higher frequencies of National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria grade 3/4 neutropenia in patients who received oxaliplatin plus LV5FU2.",
        "The fastest length of time for oxaliplatin infusion is 30 minutes. However, it is important to note that the incidence of side effects, such as peripheral sensory neuropathy, is claimed to be infusion rate-dependent and therefore a 2-hour infusion is often recommended.

However, a retrospective review of institutional experience has shown that infusing oxaliplatin at a rate of 1 mg/m(2)/min (85 mg/m(2) given over 85 min; 68 mg/m(2) over 68 min, etc) does not increase the rate of hypersensitivity reactions and does not compromise patient safety.",

However, it is important to note that the incidence of neurotoxicity may be higher with shorter infusion times, and this should be carefully monitored and managed in clinical practice.",
        "Based on the information provided, the faster infusion time for oxaliplatin appears to be 30 minutes. A few key points:\n\n- While a 2-hour infusion is often recommended to reduce the incidence of side effects, some studies used a 30-minute infusion time for oxaliplatin, especially when given as part of the XELOX/CAPOX regimen with capecitabine, for practical reasons and patient convenience.\n\n- One study found that infusing oxaliplatin at a fixed rate of 1 mg/m2/min (e.g. 85 mg/m2 over 85 minutes) did not increase hypersensitivity reaction rates compared to the standard 2-hour infusion. \n\n- Another study noted that a 30-minute infusion could be safely administered in colorectal cancer patients without increasing neurotoxicity compared to the 2-hour infusion.\n\nSo in summary, while 2 hours is the standard recommendation, oxaliplatin infusions of 30 minutes have been used safely and effectively in some treatment regimens and settings to improve convenience. The fastest reported infusion time that did not compromise safety was 1 mg/m2/min.",
        "Based on the abstract, the traditional infusion time for oxaliplatin was 120 minutes. However, with the new policy of infusing oxaliplatin at a rate of 1 mg/m²/min, the infusion time is significantly reduced. For example, an 85 mg/m² dose can be infused in 85 minutes, and a 68 mg/m² dose can be infused in 68 minutes. Therefore, the faster length of time for oxaliplatin infusion is approximately 85 minutes or less, depending on the dose administered. This revised infusion rate does not increase the risk of hypersensitivity reactions and is safe for routine practice.",

        "Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are non-coding RNA molecules produced by the transcription of DNA cis-acting elements called enhancers. eRNAs are relatively short-lived RNA species that are transcribed at very high rates but also quickly degraded. Nevertheless, eRNAs are deeply intertwined within enhancer regulatory networks and are implicated in a number of transcriptional control mechanisms. Recent studies revealed that the transcription of eRNAs may be a biological marker of enhancer activity that can participate in the regulation of coding gene transcription."

Recently, the severity of this infection was increasingly discussed and the international guidelines now differ. Since 2012, the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended nutrition through raw breast milk for all preterm infants. Case We report the case of an infant born prematurely at 27 weeks and 4 days and fed with raw breastmilk from day 12 of life (D12). He presented with a late-onset of CMV infection from D39. The CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR), negative on D3, was strongly positive on D49, as well as the PCR on breast milk. He had CMV-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) M while his mother had only CMV-specific IgG. On D52, he deteriorated further with septic shock, and a fatal cardiac arrest on D54. His twin presented an asymptomatic CMV infection. The autopsy and histological examination showed evidence of numerous organ damage caused by CMV (with differences compared with congenital infection) but no evidence of bacterial infection. Conclusion Although rare, postnatal CMV infections transmitted by raw breast milk given to very low-birthweight infants can have dramatic consequences.",

However, in preterm, very-low birthweight (VLBW) infants (\u003c1500 g), pCMV can result in a severe sepsis-like syndrome, with wide-ranging end-organ disease manifestations. Although such short-term complications are well recognized among clinicians caring for premature infants, the long-term risks with respect to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes remain controversial. In this review, we provide an overview of the clinical manifestations of breast milk-acquired pCMV infection. In particular, we summarize studies that have examined-sometimes with conflicting conclusions-the risks of long-term adverse neurodevelopmental outcome in VLBW infants that acquire pCMV from breast milk.

Fortunately, both incidence and deaths have declined due to the increased use of CRC screening to find and remove precancerous polyps and to diagnose CRC at earlier, more treatable stages. Deaths from CRC have shifted to a new demographic, with a recent increase in incidence of 2% per year in people younger than 55 years. The American Cancer Society has issued a qualified recommendation that screening start at the age of 45 years because of this increase in early-onset CRC. There are multiple CRC screening test options. Professional organizations vary in their screening guidelines, but regardless of these differences, screening has been shown to save lives. Currently, one out of every three adults aged 50-75 years are not screened as recomm",

Articles discussing CRC screening methods and updated guidelines were reviewed.RESULTS: After reviewing the full text of 55 studies, it was found that the screening tests for CRC are divided into stool-based, endoscopic, and molecular. All CRC screening guidelines recommend screening starting at age 45-50, but vary regarding screening methods, frequency, and timing of screening discontinuation. Controversies include clinical benefits of screening the elderly and discontinuation of screening. Effective screening barriers involve patient- and healthcare-related factors.CONCLUSION: Overall, screening should start at age 45-50 for average-risk individuals.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome displays a high clinical and genetic heterogeneity and harbors many multidisciplinary properties. Certain subtypes only affect the quality of life, while other forms may lead to severe, even fatal vascular or intestinal complications. Last year, based on the data of various international genotype-phenotype correlation studies of large populations, a new classification of the syndrome\u0027s clinical subtypes was introduced.

Generally, PRES is less common in children than in the adult population and is a rare complication of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI). Presentation with secondary hemorrhage also can occur.

Tumors with the pMMR/MSS phenotype often exhibit a lower tumor mutation burden and fewer tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes than dMMR/MSI-H, leading to immune tolerance and evasion in the tumor microenvironment.

Although immunotherapy has dramatically changed the landscape of treatment for many advanced cancers, the benefit in CRC has thus far been limited to patients with microsatellite instability high (MSI-H):DNA mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) tumors. Recent studies in the refractory CRC setting have led to US Food and Drug Administration approvals for pembrolizumab as well as nivolumab (with or without ipilimumab) for tumors harboring an MSI-H:dMMR molecular profile. Several randomized controlled trials are underway to move immunotherapy into the frontline for metastatic cancer (with or without chemotherapy) and the adjuvant setting. Awareness of these studies is critical given the relatively low incidence (approximately 3%-5%) of MSI-H:dMMR in advanced or metastatic CRC to support study completion, because the results could be potentially practice changing. The real challenge in this disease is related to demonstrating the benefit of immunotherapy for the vast majority of patients with CRC not harboring MSI-H:dMMR.

Unfortunately, however, not all CRC cases with the dMMR-MSI-H phenotype respond well to ICIs, and ongoing studies are currently exploring biomarkers that can predict good response to them. Another challenge lies in developing novel treatment strategies for the subset of patients with the mismatch repair-proficient-microsatellite instability-low (pMMR-MSI-L) phenotype that comprises 95% of all mCRC cases in whom treatment with currently approved ICIs has been largely unsuccessful. Approaches aiming at overcoming the resistance of tumors in this subset of patients are being developed including combining different checkpoint inhibitors with either chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents, cancer vaccines, adoptive cell transfer (ACT), or bispecific T-cell (BTC) antibodies.

Indeed, PONs possess numerous atheroprotective properties, which include antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory action, preserving HDL function, stimulation of cholesterol efflux, anti-apoptosis, anti-thrombosis, and anti-adhesion.

It has been shown to have positive antitumor efficacy and acceptable toxicity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) refractory to standard therapies. A phase II clinical trial found that the combination of raltitrexed and irinotecan biweekly administered as the second-line therapy for mCRC patients demonstrated an objective response rate of 8.6% and a disease control rate of 71.4%, with a median progression-free survival of 4.5 months (95% CI 3.8-5.2) and a median overall survival of 12.0 months (95% CI 8.5-15.5). Raltitrexed has also been used in combination with S-1 in a phase II study for heavily pretreated mCRC, with an objective response rate of 7.62% and a disease control rate of 48.57%. Additionally, a case report describes a patient with mCRC who received third-line treatment with fruquintinib, raltitrexed, and S-1 and achieved a partial response.

It is a suitable option for patients with fluoropyrimidine-induced cardiotoxicity or a significant history of cardiac disease. The emerging therapeutic role of raltitrexed includes its use as an alternative to fluoropyrimidines in patients who experience severe toxicities, such as cardiotoxicity, during treatment. Additionally, raltitrexed can be considered for patients with left-sided colon cancer, which is associated with a longer progression-free survival and overall survival. Overall, raltitrexed provides a well-tolerated and effective treatment option for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have experienced difficulties with fluoropyrimidine-based therapies.",

Treatment of advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, as an alternative to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) based chemotherapy regimens, either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents.\n\n2. Neoadjuvant therapy in combination with radiotherapy prior to surgery for rectal cancer, to shrink the tumor and improve surgical outcomes. \n\n3. Adjuvant therapy in combination with radiotherapy following surgery for rectal cancer, to reduce the risk of local recurrence and improve survival.\n\nIn summary, raltitrexed is indicated for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer and as a neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy in combination with radiotherapy for rectal cancer. Its convenience of administration as a single agent every 3 weeks makes it an attractive alternative to 5-FU based regimens in these settings.",

The mechanism of action of raltitrexed is distinct from that of 5-FU, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and other drugs, making it suitable for combination therapies to improve treatments for advanced CRC and other refractory cancers. Specific clinical indications for raltitrexed in patients with CRC include monotherapy and combinations, such as the promising antitumor effects seen when used with oxaliplatin in first-line treatment of advanced CRC and malignant mesothelioma.",
        "Raltitrexed, also known as Tomudex, is a medication used in the first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). It is a convenient alternative to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as it offers similar efficacy with a more favorable administration schedule. The clinical indications for Raltitrexed in patients with CRC include use as a monotherapy for the first-line treatment of advanced disease. It is important to note that the use of Raltitrexed should be based on individual patient characteristics and clinical judgment, taking into account potential benefits and risks.",
        "Raltitrexed is used as a first-line treatment for advanced colorectal cancer. It is licensed for this use and has been shown to be effective in treating this condition. It is often used as an alternative to 5-fluorouracil monotherapy.",
        "The clinical indications for the use of Raltitrexed in patients with colorectal cancer include first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer, particularly as an alternative to 5-fluorouracil.",
        "Raltitrexed (\u0027Tomudex\u0027) is used as a first-line treatment for advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). It serves as an alternative to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and is administered conveniently, making it a suitable option for patients in managing this condition.",
        "Raltitrexed, also known as Tomudex, is a conveniently administered alternative to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC).",
        "Raltitrexed is indicated as a first-line monotherapy alternative to 5-fluorouracil for patients with metastatic or locally advanced colorectal cancer who haven\u0027t received prior chemotherapy.",
        "Raltitrexed, also known as \u0027Tomudex\u0027, is indicated for use in the first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC), either as a monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents like oxaliplatin, due to its specific mode of action as a thymidylate synthase inhibitor and its distinct toxicity profile from 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).",
        "Raltitrexed is a potent and selective inhibitor of the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), which is involved in the biosynthesis of polyamines, which are essential for cell proliferation and survival. In colorectal cancer, ODC is overexpressed and correlates with poor prognosis. Raltitrexed has been shown to be effective in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer, particularly in patients who have failed previous chemotherapy.",
        "Clinical indications for using Raltitrexed in patients with colorectal cancer are: 1) First-line treatment of advanced CRC, and 2) a monotherapy alternative to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for metastatic or locally advanced CRC without prior chemotherapy.",
        "Based on the provided snippet, Raltitrexed (Tomudex) is indicated for the first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). This suggests that Raltitrexed can be used as a monotherapy alternative to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in patients with metastatic or locally advanced CRC who have not received prior chemotherapy. Therefore, the clinical indication for the use of Raltitrexed is first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer.",

Additionally, a new triple therapy CFTR modulator, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor, has been developed and is capable of treating 90% of patients with CF, showing the greatest FEV1 improvement of any CFTR modulator yet. Other treatments in development include gene therapy, such as RNA therapy, gene transfer, and gene editing, which aim to restore the function of the CFTR protein and potentially cure the disease.",

Examples include ivacaftor (Kalydeco), lumacaftor (Orkambi), tezacaftor (Symdeko), and elexacaftor (Trikafta).\n- Triple combination therapy: a combination of elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor (ETI) has been shown to be highly effective.\n- Gene therapy: introducing a healthy copy of the CFTR gene into the body to replace the faulty one.\n- RNA therapies: repairing or replacing the faulty CFTR protein. Examples include RNA interference (RNAi) and antisense oligonucleotides.\n- Gene editing: using technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the faulty CFTR gene and restore its function.\n- Osmotic therapy: inhaled osmotic agents, such as hypertonic saline and mannitol, to help loosen and clear mucus from the lungs.\n- Phage therapy: using bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) to treat cystic fibrosis-related lung infections.\n- Inhaled antibiotics: treating bacterial infections in the lungs with antibiotics such as tobramycin and aztreonam.\n- CFTR potentiators: drugs, such as ivacaftor, that increase the function of the faulty CFTR protein.\n- CFTR correctors: drugs, such as lumacaftor and tezacaftor, that correct the faulty folding of the CFTR protein.",

In the era of personalized medicine, tumor sampling is essential for characterizing the molecular profile of individual tumors. This provides pivotal information regarding optimal sequencing of therapy and emergence of drug resistance, allowing for timely therapy adjustment. However, tumor tissue sampling offers static information in a single time point and area of disease at the time of biopsy, which may not entirely represent the heterogeneity of molecular alterations. Moreover, tumor biopsies often involve invasive procedures with potential risks to patients. Less invasive, safer, and real-time methods such as liquid biopsies have generated increasing interest as a surrogate of solid tumor biopsies. Liquid biopsy allows for noninvasive survey with detection of cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) or circulating tumor cells. Blood-based assays are the most widely studied. Additionally, the quantity of ctDNA detected has been shown to correlate with tumor burden and enables assessment of tumor heterogeneity. In this article, we discuss the concept of liquid biopsies including ctDNA and circulating tumor cell, and their current application in the diagnosis and management of CRC.

While it may offer advantages such as non-invasiveness and ease of use, the current evidence suggests that incorporating liquid biopsy as a first- or second-line screening strategy would not be a cost-effective approach compared to existing screening methods. Further improvements in the test\u0027s performance and/or reductions in its cost may be necessary for liquid biopsy to become a viable and cost-effective option for population-based colorectal cancer screening.",

Whereas sequence complementarity between guide RNA and target DNA substantially dictates cleavage efficiency, DNA accessibility of the targeted loci has also been hypothesized to be an important factor. In this study, functional data from two genome-wide assays, genome-wide, unbiased identification of DSBs enabled by sequencing (GUIDE-seq) and circularization for in vitro reporting of cleavage effects by sequencing (CIRCLE-seq), have been computationally analyzed in conjunction with DNA accessibility determined via DNase I-hypersensitive sequencing from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Database and transcriptome from the Sequence Read Archive to determine whether cellular factors influence CRISPR-induced cleavage efficiency. CIRCLE-seq and GUIDE-seq datasets were selected to represent the absence and presence of cellular factors, respectively. Data analysis revealed that correlations between sequence similarity and CRISPR-induced cleavage frequency were altered by the presence of cellular factors that modulated the level of DNA accessibility. The above-mentioned correlation was abolished when cleavage sites were located in less accessible regions. Furthermore, CRISPR-mediated edits were permissive even at regions that were insufficient for most endogenous genes to be expressed.

        "Yes, chromatin accessibility significantly affects CRISPR-Cas9 efficiency. The abstracts collectively demonstrate that gene editing is more efficient in euchromatin (open chromatin) than in heterochromatin (closed chromatin). This correlation is observed in various cell lines and organisms, including HEK293T cells, HeLa cells, human fibroblasts, and zebrafish embryos. The studies show that chromatin openness positively correlates with CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis efficiency, whereas closed chromatin regions exhibit reduced editing efficiency. These findings are consistent across different experimental settings, including in vitro and in vivo systems. Furthermore, modulating chromatin accessibility using transactivation or targeting proximal dsgRNAs can enhance Cas9 editing efficiency in vivo. Therefore, considering chromatin accessibility is crucial for optimizing CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing outcomes."

The main outcome measures in this systematic review were the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of screening versus no-screening and then in comparison with other screening techniques. The ICER is defined by the difference in cost between two possible interventions, divided by the difference in their effect.RESULTS: Eight studies were identified and retained for the final analysis. In this study, when screening techniques were compared to no-screening, all CRC screening techniques showed to be cost-effective. The lowest ICER calculated was $PPP -16265/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (the negative ICERs were between purchasing power parity in US dollar ($PPP) -16265/QALY to $PPP -1988/QALY, whereas the positive ICERs were between $PPP 1257/QALY to $PPP 55987/QALY). For studies comparing various screening techniques, there was great heterogeneity in terms of the structures of the analyses, leading to diverse conclusions about their incremental cost-effectiveness.CONCLUSION: All CRC screening techniques were cost-effective, compared with the no-screening methods. The cost-effectiveness of the various screening techniques mainly was dependent on the context-specific parameters and highly affected by the framework of the cost-effectiveness analysis.

Although immunochemical fecal tests (FIT) and guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (g-FOBT) have been shown to be cost-effective in France, cost-effectiveness of endoscopic screening has not yet been addressed.METHODS: Cost-effectiveness of screening strategies using colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, second-generation colon capsule endoscopy (CCE), FIT and g-FOBT were compared using a Markov model. A 40 % adherence rate was assumed for all strategies. Colonoscopy costs included anesthesiologist assistance. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Probabilistic and value-of-information analyses were used to estimate the expected benefit of future research. A third-payer perspective was adopted.RESULTS: In the reference case analysis, FIT repeated every year was the most cost-effective strategy, with an ICER of €48165 per life-year gained vs. FIT every 2 years, which was the next most cost-effective strategy. Although CCE every 5 years was as effective as FIT 1-year, it was not a cost-effective alternative. Colonoscopy repeated every 10 years was substantially more costly, and slightly less effective than FIT 1-year. When projecting the model outputs onto the French population, the least (g-FOBT 2-years) and most (FIT 1-year) effective strategies reduced the absolute number of annual CRC deaths from 16037 to 12916 and 11217, respectively, resulting in an annual additional cost of €26 million and €347 million, respectively. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that FIT 1-year was the optimal choice in 20% of the simulated scenarios, whereas sigmoidoscopy 5-years, colonoscopy, and FIT 2-years were the optimal choices in 40%, 26%, and 14%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: A screening program based on FIT 1-year appeared to be the most cost",

A microsimulation model was used to estimate the cost effectiveness associated with each strategy.RESULTS: Compared with no screening, FIT was associated with a 14.0 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) increase of €50,520 per 1000 individuals, giving an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €3600/QALY. Only stool DNA and blood-based testing were associated with a QALY increase compared with FIT, with stool DNA weakly dominated by blood-based testing, and the latter associated with an ICER of €154,600/QALY compared with FIT.

Flexible sigmoidoscopy, FOBT, and FIT all dominated the current standard of care, while colonoscopy and FIT-DNA were cost-effective. Regardless of screening modality, CRC screening at 40 years old is cost-effective with increased QALYs compared to current screening initiation at 50 years old, with flexible sigmoidoscopy being the most preferred option.

However, several studies suggest that flexible sigmoidoscopy, fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), and fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) are cost-effective screening options. In particular, flexible sigmoidoscopy has been found to be the most favorable intervention by net monetary benefit in some studies.

However, the cost-effectiveness of various screening techniques may vary depending on context-specific parameters and the framework of the cost-effectiveness analysis. It is important to adopt a reference-based methodology for economic evaluation studies to make them comparable.",

However, the cost-effectiveness of various screening techniques may vary depending on the context-specific parameters and the framework of the cost-effectiveness analysis. A one-time colonoscopy at age 60 may also be a more cost-effective method for some individuals. It is important to adopt a reference-based methodology for economic evaluation studies to make them comparable.",
        "Colonoscopy every 10 years is the most cost-effective primary colorectal cancer (CRC) screening strategy in the general population according to a decision tree modeling study. Flexible sigmoidoscopy, fecal occult blood test (FOBT), and fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) were more effective than standard care, while colonoscopy and FIT-DNA were cost-effective. Screening at 40 years old is recommended for average risk individuals as it increases QALYs compared to starting at 50 years old, with flexible sigmoidoscopy being the most preferred option.",
        "Colonoscopy every 10 years is considered the most cost-effective CRC screening strategy for the general population, achieving nearly half of the reduction in CRC mortality obtainable with colonoscopy every 10 years. The combination of annual FOBT plus sigmoidoscopy every 5 years is also cost-effective but less effective than colonoscopy every 10 years. Compliance rates significantly affect incremental CE ratios, and mathematical modeling used to inform clinical guidelines needs to take this into account.",
        "A systematic review of cost-effectiveness analyses of colorectal cancer screening in Europe suggests that fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) has shown to be cost-effective in most European countries. However, the review points out that most studies have not evaluated optimal screening intervals and may therefore have overestimated the cost-effectiveness of screening.",
        "Colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy are cost-effective strategies for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in the general population, with colonoscopy having an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $28,071 per life-year gained, while flexible sigmoidoscopy has a cost-utility of $32,284 per person and offers the greatest net monetary benefit among all screening modalities assessed. Both procedures are considered cost-effective options for CRC screening.",
        "The most cost-effective colorectal cancer (CRC) screening strategy in a general population is a subject of multiple cost-effectiveness analyses, and the results can vary depending on regional epidemiology, available screening strategies, and local healthcare systems. However, several studies suggest that some screening methods are more cost-effective than others. Fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) and colonoscopy are frequently reported as cost-effective options. For instance, in a systematic review, CRC screening with colonoscopy and FIT was found to be cost-effective compared to no screening. Another study found that, under the assumption of perfect adherence, annual mSEPT9 screening resulted in more quality-adjusted life-years gained and averted more CRC cases and deaths than annual FIT screening, but it led to a higher rate of colonoscopy referrals. Ultimately, the choice of the most cost-effective CRC screening strategy should consider factors such as effectiveness, harms, cost, screening interval, patient preferences, and test availability.",
        "The most cost-effective colorectal cancer screening strategy for the general population is not definitively established, as it depends on various factors such as the specific population, healthcare system, and available resources. However, several studies suggest that flexible sigmoidoscopy, fecal immunochemical test (FIT), and fecal occult blood test (FOBT) are cost-effective screening strategies. The American Cancer Society recommends a combination of FOBT and flexible sigmoidoscopy, while some experts believe that a one-time colonoscopy at age 60 may be a more cost-effective method. A systematic review found that all colorectal cancer screening techniques were cost-effective compared to no-screening methods, but the cost-effectiveness of the various screening techniques mainly depended on context-specific parameters and was highly affected by the framework of the cost-effectiveness analysis.",
        "The most cost-effective colorectal cancer screening strategy for the general population is colonoscopy every 10 years. This method reduces mortality at relatively low incremental costs. However, if compliance rates are low, annual fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) becomes a more cost-effective option. Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 or 10 years is less cost-effective than the other two screening methods. These conclusions are based on computer models of a Markov process that compare the cost-effectiveness of fecal occult blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy by using U.S. vital statistics, cancer statistics, published data on the sensitivity, specificity, and efficacy of various screening techniques, and Medicare reimbursement data for costs.",
        "Based on the abstracts provided, colonoscopy is the most cost-effective strategy for colorectal cancer screening in the general population. According to the first abstract, colonoscopy had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $28,071 per life-year gained, making it a cost-effective strategy. The inclusion of liquid biopsy as a first- or second-line screening strategy was not cost-effective at its current cost and screening performance. In contrast, the second abstract compared the cost-effectiveness of faecal immunochemical test (FIT) vs. colonoscopy and found that colonoscopy detected more adenomas and advanced lesions or cancer than FIT, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranging from $3,489 to $922,762 depending on the outcome measured. Overall, colonoscopy is the most cost-effective strategy for colorectal cancer screening in the general population.",
        "colonoscopy was the preferred, or cost-effective, strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $28 071 per life-year gained",
        "A comparison of colonoscopy and FIT (fecal immunochemical test) as strategies for colorectal cancer screening in the general population suggests that colonoscopy is a cost-effective strategy for colorectal cancer screening, particularly when considering adenoma, advanced neoplasia, and a composite endpoint of advanced neoplasia or stage I CRC. Compared to FIT, colonoscopy is the preferred or cost-effective strategy, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $28,071 per life-year gained. Therefore colonoscopy is the most cost-effective type of colorectal cancer screening for the general population.",
        "Colonoscopy is considered the most cost-effective strategy for colorectal cancer screening in the general population.

Colonoscopy is considered the most cost-effective strategy for colorectal cancer screening in the general population.",
        "Colonoscopy is considered to be the most cost-effective strategy for colorectal cancer screening in the general population. This was found in multiple studies, including one from 2023 which reported that colonoscopy was the preferred, or cost-effective, strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $28,071 per life-year gained. Another study from 2014 found that when compared to FIT, colonoscopy is considered cost-effective for screening adenoma, advanced neoplasia, and a composite endpoint of advanced neoplasia or stage I CRC.",

This is based on a comparison to fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) where colonoscopy was found to be cost-effective for screening adenoma, advanced neoplasia, and a composite endpoint of advanced neoplasia or stage I colorectal cancer.

        "Colonoscopy is recognized as the most cost-effective strategy for colorectal cancer screening in the general population, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $28,071 per life-year gained.",
        "Summary: Colonoscopy is the most cost-effective strategy for colorectal cancer screening in the general population, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $28,071 per life-year gained according to one abstract. The inclusion of liquid biopsy was not found to be cost-effective at its current cost and performance. Comparing colonoscopy vs. faecal immunochemical test (FIT), colonoscopy detects more adenomas, advanced lesions, or cancer than FIT with a varying incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.",
        "The most cost-effective type of colorectal cancer screening for the general population is colonoscopy, as it has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $28,071 per life-year gained, according to an economic evaluation comparing no screening and five colorectal cancer screening strategies including colonoscopy, liquid biopsy, liquid biopsy following nonadherence to colonoscopy, stool DNA, and fecal immunochemical test.",
        "Based on the provided information, colonoscopy appears to be the most cost-effective colorectal cancer screening strategy for the general population. The summary states that modeling studies suggest fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) every 1-2 years, sigmoidoscopy every 5 years with FOBT every 2-3 years, and colonoscopy every 10 years are all considered cost-effective compared to no screening. However, the additional evidence specifically highlights that colonoscopy was found to be cost-effective compared to no screening and even compared to FIT (fecal immunochemical testing, a type of FOBT), with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $28,071 per life-year gained. So while all three main screening strategies are cost-effective, colonoscopy seems to be the preferred choice from a cost-effectiveness perspective for average-risk individuals.",
        "The most cost-effective type of colorectal cancer screening for the general population is colonoscopy, as it is the preferred strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $28,071 per life-year gained, and is particularly effective for screening adenoma, advanced neoplasia, and stage I colorectal cancer."

Comorbidities such as2021), and aggravating or attenuating factors is essential to reduce this gap.",
        "Mortality rates in schizophrenia are two- to three-fold higher than those of the general population, corresponding to a 10-25-year reduction in life expectancy. Natural deaths account for about 60% of the excess mortality, with ischemic heart disease being a common cause. Suicide is also a significant cause of death, with a rate of 10-20%. The overall PYLL (potential years of life lost) of people with schizophrenia is 18.4 years, with suicide having the largest PYLL (31.2 years) among all causes of mortality. Long-lasting negative health habits, disease- and treatment-related metabolic disorders, and consequent increased frequencies of cardiovascular diseases may contribute to the high death rates."

Exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R substitutions account for 90%, while EGFR exon 20 insertions constitute 4-10% of EGFR mutations and are the third most prevalent activating EGFR mutations. EGFR exon 20 insertions are associated with decreased sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and, until recently, effective targeted therapy against these tumours remained an unmet clinical need and chemotherapy was the only treatment of choice available. The approval of amivantamab and mobocertinib for patients who have progressed after chemotherapy represents an important step forward in the management of these patients. ",

In the absence of randomized trials performed specifically with elderly patients, retrospective analyses demonstrate that the influence on the time to tumour recurrence (TTR) may be the same as in young individuals, but that endpoints that include death for any reason, such as recurrence-free survival (RFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS), are poorer in the elderly. This is particularly true if oxaliplatin has been part of the treatment. The need for adjuvant chemotherapy after colorectal cancer surgery in elderly patients is basically the same as that in younger patients. The reduction in recurrence risks may be similar, provided the chosen treatment is tolerated but survival gains are less. Adding oxaliplatin to a fluoropyrimidine is probably not beneficial in individuals above a biological age of approximately 70 years. If an oxaliplatin combination is administered to elderly patients, three months of therapy is in all probability the most realistic goal.",

Another study in Australia demonstrated a persistent survival benefit for the addition of oxaliplatin to fluoropyrimidine as adjuvant treatment for Stage III colon cancer in elderly patients, although with increased hospital admissions and early chemotherapy cessation. A population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada found that patients aged ≥70 years had a higher risk of developing peripheral neuropathy with oxaliplatin-based regimens.

        "The rationale behind treating melanoma with immunotherapy is that melanoma is a highly immunogenic cancer, meaning the immune system can recognize and attack it. Key points:\n\n1. Melanoma cells express tumor-specific antigens that immune cells can target.\n\n2. Melanomas often have lymphocytic infiltrates, showing the immune system does react to the cancer. \n\n3. Melanoma patients can respond to immunotherapies like immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1), which take the brakes off the immune response.\n\n4. Adoptive cell transfer using a patient\u0027s own anti-tumor T cells extracted from the tumor can lead to responses.\n\n5. Melanoma has multiple mechanisms of immune evasion that immunotherapies can counteract.\n\nIn summary, melanoma\u0027s immunogenicity and evidence that boosting anti-tumor immunity with immunotherapies can lead to clinical responses provides a strong rationale for this treatment approach. Harnessing the immune system allows specific targeting of melanoma cells."

They are complex and multisystem diseases, with the majority being highly disabling because of major joint problems and neurosensory deficiencies, and in some cases, they may be life-threatening due to associated complications, especially vascular disorders. In 1997, the Villefranche classification defined 6 subtypes of EDS. However, many other new variants have been described over the last years. The \"historical\" EDS were characterized by abnormalities in fibrillar collagen protein synthesis. More recently, disorders of synthesis and organization of the extracellular matrix have been shown to be responsible for other types of EDS. Thus, many EDS are in fact metabolic diseases related to enzymatic defects.

        "The current international guidelines do not recommend routine PET-CT scan during the initial evaluation of locally advanced rectal cancer patients. Nevertheless, recent research indicates that PET-CT may help in identifying suitable candidates for nonoperative management and predicting pathologic complete response after chemoradiation therapy. In a study involving 125 participants, post-chemoradiation SUVmax \u003c4.3 and %SUVmax decrease of \u003e66% were found to be equally effective at predicting pCR with moderate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. These findings imply that PET-CT might assist in identifying patients who did not achieve pCR as well as overall survival in those undergoing chemoradiation for rectal cancer. Nonetheless, additional studies are necessary to validate these results.",

Additionally, a study found that 18F-FDG PET/CT is a valid tool that complements the clinical assessment of tumor response after chemoradiation therapy (CRT) completion in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Therefore, it could be suggested that PET-CT may have a role in the initial evaluation of locally advanced rectal cancer patients, particularly in cases with ambiguous or equivocal lesions on CT, and in assessing treatment response after CRT completion.

The use of PET-CT in the initial evaluation of rectal cancer patients should be individualized based on the patient\u0027s clinical presentation and the availability of other imaging modalities such as MRI and CT.",
        "According to international guidelines, PET-CT is not routinely recommended for the initial evaluation of locally advanced rectal cancer. However, recent studies have shown that PET-CT can impact clinical management and radiation treatment planning in these patients. A meta-analysis found that post-CRT PET-CT showed a reduction in SUVmax and response index (RI) irrespective of histological findings. Tumors confirmed to have regressed after CRT had a higher mean RI compared with nonresponders, and histopathological responders had a lower post-CRT SUVmax. Therefore, PET-CT may be a useful addition to current imaging modalities in assessing treatment response. However, more research is needed before routine use of PET-CT can be recommended for the initial evaluation of locally advanced rectal cancer patients.",
        "Based on the provided information, routine PET-CT scans may be indicated in the initial evaluation of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Here\u0027s why:\n\n1. PET-CT combines functional and anatomical imaging, allowing precise localization of metabolic activity and identification of cancerous formations regardless of size. This is important for accurate staging.\n\n2. For colorectal cancer, PET-CT is used to determine if metastases are present in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis after initial CT discovery of the cancer. Identifying metastases is crucial for staging and treatment planning.\n\n3. Correct staging is critical to guide appropriate treatment. Clinical staging, which includes information from PET-CT, provides key data to inform treatment decisions before surgery.\n\n4. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has become standard treatment for locally advanced rectal tumors. PET-CT staging helps identify which patients may benefit from this approach to downsize/downstage tumors before surgery and decrease local recurrence rates.\n\nIn conclusion, given the importance of accurate staging to guide treatment and the ability of PET-CT to precisely identify tumor spread, routine PET-CT scans are likely indicated in the initial evaluation of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. However, MRI also plays a key role in local tumor assessment and monitoring response to neoadjuvant therapy.",

A further 25-30% of patients with Prader-Willi syndrome do not have paternal deletions, the defect being due to uniparental disomy (UPD) for maternal chromosome 15. Paternal deletions and maternal UPD are functionally equivalent, as they both result in the absence of a paternal contribution to the genome in the 15q11-13 region. The SNRPN (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated polypeptide N) gene has a critical role in the 15q11-13 region, as it is probably part of the putative imprinting centre that regulates the expression of several genes in the Prader-Willi syndrome transcriptional domain. Two further rare causes of Prader-Willi syndrome are imprinting mutations, which are microdeletions or point mutations in the putative imprinting control region, and translocations with their breakpoints in the Prader-Willi syndrome region.",

An imprinting center controls the expression of imprinted genes in the chromosome 15q11-q13 region. Key findings include infantile hypotonia, a poor suck, failure to thrive and hypogonadism/hypogenitalism. Short stature and small hands/feet due to growth and other hormone deficiencies, hyperphagia and marked obesity occur in early childhood, if uncontrolled. Cognitive and behavioral problems (tantrums, compulsions, compulsive skin picking) are common.OBJECTIVE: Hyperphagia and obesity with related complications are major causes of morbidity and mortality in PWS.

The primary objective was to estimate the proportion of patients who became suitable for TME after chemotherapy.RESULTS: Forty-five patients were eligible (39 candidates for extensive surgery and 6 unresectable). Previous radiotherapy was given concurrently with chemotherapy in 43 cases (median dose: 54.0 Gy). Oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based salvage chemotherapy was administered in 40 (88.9%) and 5 (11.1%) cases, respectively. Eight patients (17.8%) became suitable for TME after chemotherapy, 10 (22.2%) ultimately underwent TME with clear margins, and 2 (4.4%) were managed with a watch and wait approach. Additionally, 13 patients had extensive surgery with curative intent. Three-year progression-free survival and 5-year overall survival in the entire population were 30.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.0-46.0) and 44.0% (95% CI: 26.0-61.0), respectively.

Studies suggest that local tumor control is increased in some visceral tumor types, especially with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. In some other studies, a better control of systemic disease has contributed to significantly improved survival rates. Additionally, delaying surgery offers the chance to bring the patient into a better general condition for major surgery, but it also confers the risk of progression. Although it is a relatively rare event, cancers may progress locally during neoadjuvant treatment or distant metastases may occur, jeopardizing a curative surgical treatment approach. Although this is seen as risk of neoadjuvant treatment, it can also be seen as a chance to select only those patients for surgery who have a better control of systemic disease. Some studies showed increased perioperative morbidity in patients who underwent neoadjuvant treatment, which is another potential disadvantage. Optimal multidisciplinary teamwork is key to controlling that risk. Meanwhile, the neoadjuvant treatment period is also used as a \"window of opportunity\" for studying the activity of novel drugs and for investigating predictive and prognostic biomarkers of chemoradiotherapy and radiochemotherapy.",

A retrospective review of patients who underwent surgery by more than 10 weeks after neoadjuvant therapy showed no significant difference in postoperative complications compared to those who underwent surgery within 10 weeks. Therefore, there is some evidence to suggest that delaying surgical resection after nCRT for locally advanced rectal cancer may improve pathological outcomes without increasing postoperative morbidity. However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings.",
        "The optimal timing of surgical resection after a neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer patients is still debated. A study compared postoperative complications, pathological downstaging, disease recurrence, and survival in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who underwent surgical resection \u003c8 weeks (group A) to those who had surgery ≥8 weeks (group B) after neoadjuvant CRT. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the pCR rate between the two groups, but the longer interval group experienced significant improvement in the nodal downstaging rate. The local recurrence, distant recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were not significantly different between the two groups. Therefore, it is worth delaying surgical resection for 8 weeks or more after completion of CRT as it is safe and is associated with higher nodal downstaging rates.",
        "The optimal timing of surgical resection after a neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer patients is 8-10 weeks or 56 days.",
        "Based on the provided information, the optimal timing of surgical resection after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for locally advanced rectal cancer appears to be around 8 weeks or longer after completion of CRT.\n\nSeveral studies found that waiting 8 weeks or more after CRT was associated with higher rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) and tumor downstaging compared to shorter intervals, without increased surgical complications. One study determined 56 days (8 weeks) to be the optimal threshold for maximizing complete resection and downstaging.\n\nFor patients who achieve a clinical complete response after CRT, a non-operative \"watch and wait\" approach with close surveillance may be considered to avoid surgical morbidity. However, the articles do not provide definitive guidance on the exact optimal timing of surgery for partial responders.\n\nIn summary, a waiting period of at least 8 weeks after completing CRT seems to provide the best balance of tumor response and surgical outcomes for locally advanced rectal cancer, but the ideal timing likely depends on individual patient and tumor characteristics. Prospective randomized trials are still needed to determine the most optimal timing.",
        "The optimal timing of surgical resection after a neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer patients is still controversial. A pooled analysis of eight randomized trials, including 3085 patients, found that the best time to achieve pathological complete response (pCR) was at 10 weeks from the start of chemoradiotherapy. However, lengthening the surgical interval did not impact local recurrences, distant metastases, or overall survival. Therefore, a surgical resection delay up to 10 weeks after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy could be considered safe and may improve pCR rates without compromising oncologic outcomes.",

This is based on the study that found that 8 weeks is the critical threshold for optimal tumor response and achieving pathological complete response (pCR).

The optimal timing of surgical resection after a neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer patients is still unknown.",
        "In locally advanced rectal cancer cases following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), the optimal timing for surgical resection is approximately 8 weeks. Research shows that waiting longer than 8 weeks can lead to worse survival rates, while undergoing surgery within 25 days of diagnosis correlates with better long-term outcomes. Achieving pathological complete response at 10 weeks does not appear to compromise overall survival, suggesting that nonresponders should proceed with surgery around the 8-week mark for optimal results.",

However, a shorter interval before surgery after completing nCRT is recommended for patients who do not respond well to CRT to improve overall and disease-free survival. An adjusted analysis of the relationship between time to surgery and 10-year survival showed that patients with CC who underwent resection ≥25 days following diagnosis had similar 1-year, but inferior 5- and 10-year survival, compared to those who underwent surgery within 25 days.

Alternative therapies under investigation include, among others, the use of gene therapy to provide copies of wild-type, non-mutant, phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme. Expression of PAH in both liver (the usual metabolic source of this enzyme) and skeletal muscle is under investigation. Liver gene therapy, using a viral vector based on the adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), provided effective clearance of serum Phe that was sustained for 1 year in some mice. In order for PAH expression to be effective in skeletal muscle, the essential metabolic cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), must also be provided, either by supplementation or gene therapy. Both these approaches were effective. When transgenic PKU mice that constitutively expressed PAH in muscle were given intraperitoneal supplementation with BH(4), this produced (transient) effective clearance of Phe to normal levels. In addition, use of an AAV vector containing the genes for PAH, and for two key synthetic enzymes for BH(4), provided substantial and long-lasting correction (more than 1 year) of blood Phe levels when injected into skeletal muscle of PKU mice. These two strategies provide promising treatment alternatives for the management of PKU in patients.",

To this aim, we developed a helper-dependent adenoviral (HD-Ad) vector expressing phenylalanine hydroxylase and administered it to 3-week-old PKU mice. This resulted in complete normalization of Phe and Tyr levels and reversal of coat hypopigmentation that lasted throughout the observation period of six months. The spatial learning deficits observed in PKU mice were also reversed and hippocampus levels of the N-methyl-D-Aspartate and 2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2- oxazol-4-yl) propanoic acid receptor subunits returned to normal. Long-term potentiation, which is impaired in PKU mice, was also restored by treatment. Therefore, HD-Ad vector-mediated gene therapy is a promising approach to PKU treatment.",

The fact that the healthcare provider is able to find out additional information about the tumor at a given time, by evaluating a blood sample to obtain a \"liquid biopsy\" is of utmost importance and gives multiple potentially usable data. There are three means of obtaining biological material that may be used as \"liquid biopsy\": evaluation of circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA and exosomes.

Furthermore, integrating morphology and time-based analysis alongside standard CTC enumeration can provide greater insight into the pathophysiology of mCRC by highlighting the complexity of the disease across a patient\u0027s treatment.

It has been shown to be highly predictive of early disease recurrence in surgically resected colorectal cancer, and is superior to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in detecting residual disease and early recurrence. Additionally, pre-surgery ctDNA levels are positively correlated with tumor burden and have predictive value for relapse.

However, when comparing their performance after complete resection of CRC metastases, it is essential to consider the specific clinical context and purpose of the liquid biopsy. , For detecting residual or recurrent disease, CTCs seem to be the most reliable technique among those studied, as they showed the best diagnostic performance with a pooled sensitivity of 0.82 (95% CI 0.79-0.85) and specificity of 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-0.99).

        "The most reliable liquid biopsy technique for detecting minimal residual disease after complete resection of colorectal cancer metastases is the CellSearch method for enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). This method has been validated and approved by the FDA as a useful prognostic method for metastatic breast, colon, and prostate cancer. However, it is important to note that detecting ctDNA in blood samples can be challenging due to the presence of wild type DNA from white blood cells, and pre-analytical considerations such as preventing or delaying white cell lysis, using cell stabilization tubes, and performing a double centrifugation step can help improve ctDNA detection. Plasma is better than serum for ctDNA recovery, and ctDNA or cfDNA can be extracted from plasma fractions using commercially available kits. The analysis of ctDNA after extraction requires the use of various amplification and sequencing methods, which can be separated into two main groups: untargeted approaches (e.g., whole genome or whole exome sequencing) and targeted approaches (e.g., sequencing of ctDNA based on mutational hotspots for the cancer of interest). Targeted approaches can amplify ctDNA through polymerase chain reactions (PCR) or digital PCR, which is especially important given the low levels of DNA circulating in the bloodstream and the small proportion of ctDNA in the total cell-free DNA extracted.",

        "Underlying mechanisms that could lead to irritable bowel syndrome include genetic factors (most notably an identified mutation of SCN5A); post-infectious changes, chronic infections and disturbances in the intestinal microbiota; low-grade mucosal inflammation, immune activation, and altered intestinal permeability; disordered bile salt metabolism (in 10-20% of cases with diarrhoea); abnormalities in serotonin metabolism; and alterations in brain function, which could be primary or secondary factors.",
        "The pathophysiological mechanisms that explain irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are complex and multifactorial. While the exact causes of IBS are still not fully understood, several factors have been implicated, including:1. Gastrointestinal motility and sensory dysfunction: IBS is characterized by altered gastrointestinal motility and sensory abnormalities, including hypersensitivity to food, pain, and distension.2. Visceral hypersensitivity: Visceral hypersensitivity, or increased sensitivity to internal organ stimuli, is a key feature of IBS. This can lead to abdominal pain, bloating, and other symptoms.3. Inflammation: Inflammation is a common feature of IBS, and may contribute to symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea.4. Gut microbiota dysbiosis: Dysbiosis, or an imbalance of the gut microbiota, has been linked to IBS. This can lead to changes in gut permeability, inflammation, and other symptoms.5. Psychological factors: Psychological factors, such as stress, anxiety, and depression, can also contribute to IBS symptoms.6. Genetic predisposition: Genetic factors may also play a role in the development of IBS, as some individuals may be more susceptible to the condition due to their genetic makeup.7. Other factors: Other factors that may contribute to IBS include food intolerances, hormonal changes, and medication use.",
        "Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a complex and multifactorial disorder. These mechanisms include:\n- Visceral hypersensitivity: increased gut sensitivity to stimuli, causing abdominal pain and discomfort\n- Altered gut motility: changes in food movement through the digestive system, leading to constipation or diarrhoea\n- Dysbiosis: alterations in gut microbiota, impacting gut functions and its interaction with the brain\n- Inflammation: low-grade gut inflammation contributing to abdominal pain and bloating\n- Brain-gut axis dysfunction: abnormal brain-gut communication, altering gut functions and causing symptoms\n- Neurotransmitter imbalance: serotonin and other neurotransmitter imbalances affecting gut function\n- Genetic factors: genetic variations impacting gut function and causing IBS symptoms\n- Epigenetic factors: environmental influences on gene expression, contributing to IBS symptoms\n- Food intolerances: adverse reactions to certain foods, exacerbating IBS symptoms\n- Stress and anxiety: psychological factors affecting gut function and IBS symptoms\n- Altered bile salt metabolism: changes in bile salt processing, contributing to diarrhoea in some IBS patients\n- Mast cell activation: activation of gut mast cells, causing abdominal pain and diarrhoea\n\nThese mechanisms often overlap, and multiple factors typically contribute to IBS development in individuals."
