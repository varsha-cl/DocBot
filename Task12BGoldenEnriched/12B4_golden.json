We evaluated the prophylactic effect of scopolamine butylbromide on irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients who received irinotecan-based regimens at our outpatient chemotherapy clinic between April 2013 and May 2014 were enrolled. Patients who developed irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome were prophylactically administered scopolamine butylbromide at the next scheduled treatment. Risk factors for irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome were determined using logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: Irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome occurred in 50.8% of patients. Scopolamine butylbromide administration significantly reduced the incidence to 3.4% (P \u003c 0.01). The irinotecan dose (≥ 150 mg/m2) was the only risk factor associated with irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome.

Development of cholinergic syndrome can be ameliorated or prevented by administering various anticholinergics, including atropine sulfate or scopolamine butylbromide. Although many of the side effects are transient and non-life-threatening, their onset is painful and can lower a patient\u0027s quality of life (QoL). This retrospective study was performed to identify predictive factors of the development of irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome in order to develop future strategies for improving the QoL of patients undergoing chemotherapy. We enrolled 150 cancer patients who underwent chemotherapy, which included irinotecan, in our outpatient chemotherapy center between October 2014 and January 2017. For regression analysis, variables related to the development of irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome were extracted from the patient\u0027s clinical records. The degree of cholinergic syndrome was classified as follows: grade 0 \u003d not developed; grade 1 \u003d developed but did not require anticholinergic drugs; and grade 2 \u003d developed and required anticholinergic drugs or stopping the chemotherapy due to cholinergic syndrome. Multivariate ordered logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictive factors for the development of irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome. Threshold measurements were determined using a receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC) curve.",

In some manifestations of the syndrome such as bradycardia, careful monitoring of patients is advised. In this study, we retrospectively investigated the risk factors associated with irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome in Japanese patients with cancer.METHODS: Patients who received irinotecan-based chemotherapy between April 2014 and June 2018 were examined. Patient backgrounds and clinical data during the first cycle of an irinotecan-containing regimen, including cholinergic syndrome manifestation within 24 h after the start of treatment, were collected from medical records. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the risk of irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome.RESULTS: Among 179 patients administered an irinotecan-containing regimen, 51 experienced cholinergic syndrome after the initiation of treatment. The most common symptom was sweating followed by diarrhea, abdominal pain, lacrimation, and nasal discharge. 42 patients developed symptoms of cholinergic syndrome during their firs",

          "text": "Irinotecan hydrochloride (irinotecan) is a chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of solid tumors. In addition to severe neutropenia and delayed diarrhea, irinotecan causes cholinergic syndrome, characterized by abdominal pain and acute diarrhea. The latter symptoms are frequently observed during and after irinotecan treatment. Here, we have discussed the case of a patient who completely recovered from abdominal pain following the administration of loperamide hydrochloride (loperamide) at a dose of 2 mg, before infusing irinotecan. In contrast, anticholinergic drugs were not as effective in alleviating symptoms. A 28-year-old man with stage IV rectal cancer with peritoneal metastasis was prescribed with fluorouracil, irinotecan, and levofolinate calcium (FOLFIRI), in addition to cetuximab. Anticholinergic drugs, such as scopolamine butylbromide (scopolamine) or atropine sulfate (atropine), were administered to treat abdominal pain that was considered as irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome, but monotherapy was not effective. Thereafter, oral loperamide (2 mg) with atropine (0.25 mg) was prescribed before irinotecan infusion. Consequently, the patient did not experience any abdominal pain during and after irinotecan treatment. Loperamide is an opioid receptor agonist and decreases the activity of the myenteric plexus of the intestinal wall. It also inhibits the release of both acetylcholine and prostaglandins, resulting in decreased inhibition of peristaltic movement. We assumed that its mechanism solely or in combination contributed to symptom relief. We hypothesized that the synergistic anticholinergic interaction between loperamide and atropine resulted in marked suppression of irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome compared to loperamide alone.",

Irinotecan-treated patients have developed cholinergic syndrome due to acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme inhibition. It appears that irinotecan or its metabolites directly interact with AChE and inhibit its role of converting acetylcholine to choline, leading to an accumulation of acetylcholine and subsequent symptoms of the cholinergic syndrome. The phytochemicals present in Phyllanthus emblica, commonly referred to as amla, have been studied to determine their therapeutic effects. As an alternative treatment for cancer, this study explores the potential of phytochemicals found in amla to target and inhibit the Top1 protein. Additionally, the study aims to identify a non-inhibitor for AChE. Molecular docking studies assessed phytochemical binding affinities to Top1 and AChE enzymes, and ADME analyses were performed to assess their drug-likeness properties. Subsequently, molecular dynamic simulation was employed to assess the stability of these compounds.",

Dysarthria secondary to irinotecan has been described as a rare side effect in a few case reports with limited data to recommend appropriate management. We describe herein a large single institution experience of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies who experienced dysarthria while being treated with irinotecan-based chemotherapy regimens (FOLFIRINOX or FOLFIRI+/-bevacizumab). Eighteen patients developed neurological manifestations during irinotecan infusion with the majority ( n \u003d 17) developing dysarthria. Patients also experienced other known side effects including cholinergic effects (abdominal bloating, diarrhea, facial flushing, diaphoresis, and rhinorrhea), nausea, fatigue, perioral paresthesia and musculoskeletal discomfort. The dysarthria occurred as early as with the first infusion of irinotecan ( n \u003d 9), but several patients did not develop symptoms until subsequent infusions (range, 1-6). Dose alterations of irinotecan did not obviously impact the reccurrence or severity of dysarthria. Management strategies included close observation, atropine, slower irinotecan infusion rate, and reassurance. Dysarthria resolved without consequence in all patients within hours of completion of the infusion.",

          "text": "Irinotecan (CPT-11) is an anticancer drug that occasionally produces acute cholinergic side effects. Preliminary findings suggest that these are mediated through the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). In this study, the inhibition of various AChEs by CPT-11 was studied. The lactone form of CPT-11 resulted in apparent noncompetitive inhibition of electric eel and both human recombinant and erythrocyte AChE with K(i) values of 0.065, 0.19, and 0.29 microM, respectively. The carboxylate form of CPT-11 was approximately 10 times less potent. Apparent noncompetitive inhibition of AChE may arise through several mechanisms, and those relevant to CPT-11 were identified from key experimental findings. First, the inhibition by CPT-11 was found to be instantly reversible in dilution studies. Second, incubation of the enzyme with CPT-11 before the introduction of neostigmine protected the enzyme from inactivation. Third, regeneration of the active enzyme after preincubation with neostigmine was totally suppressed by the addition of 2 microM CPT-11, indicating that CPT-11 is a potent inhibitor of decarbamoylation and, by inference, deacylation. Additional experiments with tacrine revealed functional differences between these two inhibitors. Also, preliminary molecular modeling of the interaction between AChE and CPT-11 indicated that the latter does not bind at the same site as tacrine. Displacement studies with the peripheral site-specific ligand, propidium, confirmed that CPT-11 binds at this site.",

However, some insights can be gained from the studies. , In one study, female sex and high irinotecan dose (≥175 mg) were identified as significant predictors of cholinergic syndrome. This suggests that dose reduction or alternative dosing regimens may be considered in these patient populations. , Another study found that coadministration of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents with irinotecan increased the risk of cholinergic syndrome, implying that careful selection and sequencing of chemotherapy agents may help mitigate this risk. , The case report highlighted the potential benefit of loperamide in alleviating abdominal pain associated with irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome. While anticholinergic drugs were not effective in this patient, the combination of loperamide and atropine resulted in symptom relief. This suggests that loperamide may be a useful adjunctive therapy for managing acute cholinergic syndrome secondary to ir",
        "Irinotecan, a plant alkaloid used in cancer treatment, causes adverse reactions, especially when administered at higher doses, in combination with other drugs or in patients with low cholinesterase activity. \nThe preventive strategy relies mainly on the administration of anticholinergics such as atropine or glycopyrrolate, preferably by infusion, before the administration of irinotecan. \nFor the management of severe toxicities, high doses of atropine are recommended and it is necessary to follow a monitoring plan of heart rate and QTc interval.",
        "A retrospective study aimed to identify predictive factors for the development of irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome in order to improve the quality of life of patients undergoing chemotherapy. The study enrolled 150 cancer patients who underwent chemotherapy, which included irinotecan, in their outpatient chemotherapy center between October 2014 and January 2017. The results showed that scopolamine butylbromide was effective in preventing irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome. The only risk factor associated with irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome was the irinotecan dose (≥ 150 mg/m2), and the incidence of cholinergic syndrome in patients with this risk factor was 75%. Therefore, prophylaxis treatments for acute cholinergic syndrome secondary to irinotecan include administering anticholinergics, such as atropine sulfate or scopolamine butylbromide, and adjusting the irinotecan dose. A study on the incidence of CPT-11 (irinotecan) related cholinergic symptoms in cancer patients found that high-dose CPT-11 administration was a significant risk factor for the appearance of cholinergic symptoms. The cholinergic syndrome is caused by the inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme by irinotecan or its metabolites, leading to an accumulation of acetylcholine and subsequent symptoms. The study also explores the potential of phytochemicals found in Phyllanthus emblica (amla) as an alternative treatment for cancer to target and inhibit the Top1 protein and identify a non-inhibitor for AChE.

However, the molecular signaling pathways by which FAM134B interacts within colon carcinogenesis is still unknown. Herein, this study aims to determine the interacting partners of FAM134B for the first time in colon cancer and to explore the precise location of FAM134B in cancer signalling pathways. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) followed by anti-FAM134B co-immune precipitation of FAM134B interacting complex was used to identify the potential interactors of FAM134B in colon cancer cells. Western blot and confocal microscopic analysis were used to validate the physical interactions of FAM134B with the interactors. Lentiviral shRNA mediated silencing of FAM134B was used to examine the modulation of FAM134B interactors in cells. We have identified 29 novel binding partners, including CAP1, RPS28, FTH1, KDELR2, MAP4, EB1, PSMD6, PPIB/CYPB etc. Subsequent immunoassays confirmed the direct physical interactions of FAM134B with CAP1, EB1, CYPB, and KDELR2 in colon cancer cells. Exogenous suppression of FAM134B has led to significant upregulation of EB1 as well as reduction of KDELR2 expression. It was noted that overexpression of EB1 promotes WNT/β-catenin signaling pathways via inactivating tumor suppressor APC followed by activating β-catenin in colorectal carcinogenesis.",

Congenital mutations in the FAM134B gene have been reported to be associated with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 2B (HSAN2B); however, the molecular differences between wild-type and HSAN2B-linked FAM134B are not fully understood.METHODS AND RESULTS: We prepared several human FAM134B constructs, such as the HSAN2B-linked mutant, and compared their features with those of wild-type FAM134B by transfecting these constructs into FAM134B-deficient Neuro2a cells. Although intrinsic FAM134B protein expression in wild-type Neuro2a cells was affected by the supply of amino acids in the culture medium, the expression of each HSAN2B-linked mutant FAM134B protein was hardly affected by serum and amino acid deprivation. On the other hand, the intracellular localization of GFP-tagged HSAN2B-linked mutants, except for P7Gfs133X, overlapped well with ER-localized SP-RFPKDEL and did not differ from that of GFP-tagged wild-type FAM134B. However, analysis of protein‒protein interactions using the NanoBiT reporter assay revealed the difference between wild-type and C-terminal truncated mutant FAM134B. Furthermore, this NanoBiT assay demonstrated that both wild-type and G216R FAM134B interacted with LC3/GABARAPL1 to the same extent, but the FAM134B construct with mutations near the LC3-interacting region (LIR) did not. Similar to the NanoBiT assay, the C-terminal-truncated FAM134B showed lower ER-phagy activities, as assessed by the cotransfection of GFP-tagged reporters.CONCLUSIONS: We showed that wild-type and HSAN2B-linked FAM134B have different molecular characteristics by transfec",

FAM134B has also been associated with different cancers, although its exact role remains elusive. We report here that the FAM134B gene encodes not one but at least two different protein isoforms: the full-length and the NH2 terminally truncated forms. Their relative expression shows extreme variation, both within normal tissues and among cancer types. Expression of full-length FAM134B is restricted to the brain, testis, spleen, and prostate. In contrast, NH2 terminally truncated FAM134B is dominant in the heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, and liver. We compared wild-type and knockout mice to study the role of the Fam134b gene in starvation. NH2 terminally truncated FAM134B-2 was induced in the liver, skeletal muscle, and heart but not in the pancreas and stomach following starvation. Upon starvation, Fam134b-/- mice differed from wild-type mice by less weight loss and less hyperaminoacidemic and hypocalcemic response but increased levels of serum albumin, total serum proteins, and α-amylase.",

In this study, we investigated the function of FAM134B in HCC and the related tumorigenesis mechanisms, as well as how FAM134B induces EMT. We detected the expression of FAM134B in a normal hepatic cell line, HCC cell lines, fresh specimens, and a HCC tissue microarray. A retrospective study of 122 paired HCC tissue microarrays was used to analyze the correlation between FAM134B and clinical features. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments, rescue experiments, Akt pathway activator/inhibitors, nude mice xenograft models, and nude mice lung metastasis models were used to determine the underlying mechanisms of FAM134B in inducing tumorigenesis and EMT in vitro and in vivo. The expression level of FAM134B was highly elevated in HCC, as compared with that in normal liver tissues and normal hepatic cells. Overexpression of FAM134B was significantly associated with tumor size (P \u003d 0.025), pathological vascular invasion (P \u003d 0.026), differentiation grade (P \u003d 0.023), cancer recurrence (P \u003d 0.044), and portal vein tumor thrombus (P \u003d 0.036) in HCC.

We estimated commercial optical colonoscopy costs per screening based on the 2016 Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Database and ancillary services, such as bowel preparation, anesthesia, pathology, and complication costs. We developed 4 scenarios for CT colonography cost per screening using the ratio of commercial to Medicare fees, and calculated ancillary service and follow-up costs from payers\u0027 costs for these services when associated with optical colonoscopies. For comparison, we converted the costs per screening to the costs per screening year per person using real-world screening intervals that were obtained from peer-reviewed studies.RESULTS: In 2016, the average optical colonoscopy screening cost for commercial payers was $2033 (N \u003d 406,068), or $340 per screening year per person. With our highest-cost CT colonography scenario, CT colonography costs 22% less, or $265 per screening year, than optical colonoscopy, mostly because of the advantages for patients of no anesthesia and the grea",

CT colonography uses minimally invasive evaluation of colorectum and has better patient acceptance, which appears to be a promising screening modality to improve low colorectal cancer screening rate. This study investigated the utilization patterns of CT colonography and factors associated with its use among U.S. adult population. This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed the National Health Interview Survey 2015 and 2018. U.S. adults ages 45 or older without a history of colorectal cancer were included. Survey design-adjusted Wald F tests were used to compare the utilization of CT colonography during the study period. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of CT colonography among individual socioeconomic and health-related characteristics. The study sample included 34,768 individuals representing 129,430,319 U.S. adult population ages 45 or older. The overall utilization of CT colonography increased from 0.79% in 2015 to 1.33% in 2018 (P \u003c 0.001). 54.5% study participants reported being up-to-date on recommended colorectal cancer screening; of those, 1.8% used CT colonography.

CT colonography (CTC) might be an efficient use of resources in this situation because it allows for intraluminal and extraluminal evaluations with one test.DESIGN: We developed a simulation model to compare lifetime costs and benefits for a cohort of patients with resected CRC. Standard of care involved annual CT for 3 years and OC for years 1, 4 and every 5 years thereafter. For the CTC-based strategy, we replace CT+OC at year 1 with CTC. Patients with lesions greater than 6 mm detected by CTC underwent OC. Detection of an adenoma 10 mm or larger was followed by OC at 1 year, then every 3 years thereafter. Test characteristics and costs for CTC were derived from a clinical study. Medicare costs were used for cancer care costs as well as alternative test costs. We discounted costs and effec",

As part of a clinical trial comparing the utility of computed tomographic colonography (CTC) and optical colonoscopy (OC) for post colorectal cancer resection surveillance, we explored the diagnostic yield and costs of a strategy of CTC followed by OC if a polyp is observed (abbreviated CTC_S), versus OC 1 year following curative bowel resection, using the detection of actionable polyps on OC as the criterion. Methods. Using data from 231 patients who underwent same-day CTC followed by OC, we created a decision tree that outlined the choices and outcomes at 1-year clinical follow-up. Colorectal polyp prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity of CTC were compared with five exemplary studies and meta-analyses. Detection criteria were derived for ≥6 mm or ≥10 mm polyps. OC was the gold standard. Costs were gleaned from cataloging components of the cases at the principal investigator\u0027s institution. Analyses included marginal cost of the OC strategy to detect additional actionable polyps and number of polyps missed per 10,000 patients. Results. At our prevalence of 0.156 for ≥6 mm (0.043 ≥10 mm), CTC_S would miss 779 ≥6 mm actionable polyps per 10,000 patients (≥10 mm: 173 per 10,000). Cost to detect an additional ≥6 mm polyp in this cohort is $5,700 (≥10 mm: $28,000). Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that any improvement in performance characteristics would raise the cost of OC to detect more actionable polyps. Similar results were seen using Medicare costs, or when literature values were used for performance characteristics. Conclusion.",

We supposed that a hypothetical population of 100,000 subjects aged 50 yr undergoes a screening procedure every 10 yr. Suspicious findings of CT colonography are worked-up by colonoscopy. After polypectomy, colonoscopy is repeated every 3 yr until no adenomatous polyps are found.RESULTS: Under baseline conditions, screening by CT colonography costs $24,586 per life-year saved, compared with $20,930 spent on colonoscopy screening.

Cost-effectiveness of CTC screening is heterogeneous, due largely to between-study differences in comparators and parameter values. Future studies should: compare CTC with currently favored tests, especially fecal immunochemical tests; consider extra-colonic findings; and conduct comprehensive sensitivity analyses.",
        "According to the provided abstracts, the cost-effectiveness of CT colonography (CTC) for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is still uncertain. One study found that CTC costs 22% less than optical colonoscopy, mainly due to reduced anesthesia and pathology services. However, another study concluded that CTC cannot be recommended as a primary means of population-based CRC screening in Canada because it would cost more and result in more deaths overall compared with colonoscopy. A third abstract highlighted the need for good quality information regarding the cost-effectiveness of CTC screening and its impact on extracolonic findings. Overall, while CTC may offer patient-centered advantages and lower costs in some scenarios, its cost-effectiveness as a CRC screening test remains unclear and requires further research.",
        "Yes, CT colonography (CTC) can be a cost-effective test for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. According to multiple studies, CTC remains cost-effective under a range of assumptions and can be reasonably cost-effective when the diagnostic accuracy of CTC is high. However, for CTC to be as cost-effective as colonoscopy screening, the costs must not exceed a certain percentage of colonoscopy costs. Additionally, CTC could be a cost-effective option for CRC screening among Medicare enrollees if the reimbursement rate per scan is substantially less than that for colonoscopy or if a large proportion of otherwise unscreened persons were to undergo screening by CTC. However, when taking fecal immunochemical test (FIT) screening as the reference, imaging is not cost-effective.\n\nIn summary, CT colonography can be a cost-effective test for colorectal cancer screening, but the cost-effectiveness may depend on various factors such as the diagnostic accuracy of CTC, the cost of the test, and the proportion of unscreened individuals undergoing CTC.",
        "Yes, CT colonography (CTC) can be a cost-effective test for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening under certain conditions. A CEA would involve comparing the cost of implementing CTC to its health benefits, such as the number of lives saved or the reduction in CRC incidence. The ICER would then provide a measure of the cost-effectiveness of CTC relative to other CRC screening methods.\n\nAccording to various studies, CTC can be cost-effective when the diagnostic accuracy of CTC is high, if costs are about 60% of those of optical colonoscopy, if the reimbursement rate per scan is substantially less than that for colonoscopy, or if a large proportion of otherwise unscreened persons were to undergo screening by CTC. However, CTC needs to achieve a higher attendance rate or cost less than colonoscopy to be cost-effective relative to colonoscopy.\n\nIn summary, CTC can be a cost-effective option for CRC screening, but its cost-effectiveness depends on various factors such as the diagnostic accuracy of CTC, the cost of the test, and the proportion of unscreened individuals who would undergo CTC screening.",
        "Based on the abstracts, CT colonography can be a cost-effective test for colorectal cancer screening under certain conditions. According to one study, CT colonography is an effective and cost-effective screening test relative to no screening, but optical colonoscopy dominates 2-dimensional CT colonography done every 5 or 10 years. Another study found that CT colonography was more cost-effective than colonoscopy in strategies with multiple lifetime screenings. However, the cost-effectiveness of CT colonography depends on factors such as diagnostic accuracy, test costs, and adherence rates. If optical colonoscopy costs are high (e.g., 1.6 times more than CT colonography), or if the sensitivity of CT colonography for 1 cm adenomas is low (≤83%), then optical colonoscopy may be a dominant strategy. Overall, CT colonography can be a cost-effective complement to traditional colonoscopy if reasonably priced and used with appropriate cut-off levels (\u003e6 mm polyp) to increase its sensitivity.",
        "Yes, CT colonography is a cost-effective test for colorectal cancer screening. The higher participation rates in CT colonography screening compared to colonoscopy screening make it more cost-effective in the long run.",
        "CT colonography\u0027s cost-effectiveness for colorectal cancer screening is uncertain; it offers patient-centered advantages but may not be recommended for primary population-based screening due to higher costs and more deaths than colonoscopy in some studies, while another found CTC 22% cheaper. Further research is needed on its impact and cost-effectiveness.",
        "Yes, CT colonography (CTC) is generally considered a cost-effective test for colorectal cancer screening compared to no screening. However, the cost-effectiveness of CTC relative to other screening methods like colonoscopy depends on various factors:\n\n- CTC is cost-effective compared to no screening under a range of assumptions.\n\n- For CTC to be as cost-effective as colonoscopy screening every 10 years, it needs to be offered every 5 years and the costs must be substantially lower than colonoscopy (around 40-60% of colonoscopy costs). \n\n- CTC could be cost-effective among Medicare enrollees if the reimbursement rate is much less than colonoscopy or if it substantially increases screening rates in those who would otherwise go unscreened.\n\n- When compared to fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), CTC was found to not be cost-effective.\n\nIn summary, CTC is cost-effective compared to no screening, but colonoscopy tends to be more cost-effective in many evaluations. CTC\u0027s cost-effectiveness depends on pricing, screening interval, and its ability to improve population screening rates. More recent low-cost CTC technologies may make it more cost-competitive with colonoscopy.",

MC clinical manifestations are determined by systemic vasculitis of low/medium sized vessels (mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome or cryoglobulinemic vasculitis [CV]) caused by the deposition of cryoglobulins in blood vessels.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic review was performed via the Medline and Scopus databases to evaluate studies concerning CV treatment with new direct antiviral agents (DAAs) and their effect on the syndrome.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The introduction of interferon-free protocols has led to more evident positive effects than those observed in the treatment of hepatitis C. In fact, IFN-free, DAA-based therapy minimized side effects permitting the treatment of previously contraindicated patients and led to a particularly high SVR rate and to a clinical/immunological response in the majority of patients, even if at different levels in different pati",

Research has shown an emerging role for chemokines and type 1 cytokines in the pathophysiology of this vasculitis. Interleukin 1 (IL-1) plays a role in initiating the cascade of immunoinflammatory responses, and levels of the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) inducible chemokine CXCL10 have been shown to be significantly associated with the presence of active vasculitis in patients with MC. We evaluated serum levels of IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, and CXCL10 in a series of patients with hepatitis C-related MC (MC+HCV), and correlated these measurements with clinical disease features.METHODS: Serum IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, and CXCL10 were assayed in 54 patients with MC+HCV, in 54 sex- and age-matched patients with type C chronic hepatitis without cryoglobulinemia (HCV+), and in 54 controls.RESULTS: MC+HCV patients showed significantly higher mean IL-1beta and CXCL10 serum levels than controls (p \u003c 0.01) o",

Patients with mixed cryoglobulinemic nephropathy who have a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis should receive immunosuppressive therapy. After disease stabilization, patients should receive concurrent therapy for the underlying HCV infection. The standard therapy of a chronic HCV infection is IFN monotherapy or IFN combined with ribavirin; however, after the introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), the standard therapy for patients with HCV genotype 1 has dramatically changed. We report a case of HCV-associated cryoglobulinemic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) successfully treated by daclatasvir and asunaprevir, which are IFN-free DAAs for HCV, in combination with angiotensin II receptor blocker without immunosuppressive therapy. The patient developed severe nephrotic syndrome with progressive kidney dysfunction. Blood examination revealed a high copy number of HCV-RNA (6.4 log IU/mL, type 1), cryoglobulinemia, paraproteinemia of IgM-κ, and hypocomplementemia. Histological analysis showed MPGN type 1.",

The primary outcome was intracranial objective response rate confirmed by assessments at least 4 weeks apart, as assessed by independent review committee (IRC) using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1. Because of early closure of the BRAFV600 wild-type cohort, the primary endpoint of intracranial objective response rate by IRC assessment was not done in this cohort; intracranial objective response rate by investigator assessment was reported instead. Efficacy and safety were analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study medication. This trial is closed to enrolment and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03625141.FINDINGS: Between Dec 13, 2018, and Dec 7, 2020, 65 patients were enrolled in the BRAFV600 mutation-positive cohort; the BRAFV600 wild-type cohort was closed early after enrolment of 15 patients. Median follow-up was 9·7 months (IQR 6·3-15·0) for the BRAFV600 mutation-positive cohort and 6·2 months (3·5-23·0) for the BRAFV600 wild-type cohort. Intracranial objective response rate was 42% (95% CI 29-54) by IRC assessment in the BRAFV600 mutation-positive cohort and 27% (95% CI 8-55) by investigator assessment in the BRAFV600 wild-type cohort. Treatment-related grade 3 or worse adverse events occurred in 41 (68%) of 60 patients who received atezolizumab plus vemurafenib plus cobimetinib in the BRAFV600 mutation-positive cohort, the most common of which were lipase increased (15 [25%] of 60 patients) and blood creatine phospho",

Because of early closure of the BRAFV600 wild-type cohort, the primary endpoint of intracranial objective response rate by IRC assessment was not done in this cohort; intracranial objective response rate by investigator assessment was reported instead. Efficacy and safety were analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study medication. This trial is closed to enrolment and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03625141.FINDINGS: Between Dec 13, 2018, and Dec 7, 2020, 65 patients were enrolled in the BRAFV600 mutation-positive cohort; the BRAFV600 wild-type cohort was closed early after enrolment of 15 patients. Median follow-up was 9·7 months (IQR 6·3-15·0) for the BRAFV600 mutation-positive cohort and 6·2 months (3·5-23·0) for the BRAFV600 wild-type cohort. Intracranial objective response rate was 42% (95% CI 29-54) by IRC assessment in the BRAFV600 mutation-positive cohort and 27% (95% CI 8-55) by investigator assessment in the BRAFV600 wild-type cohort. Treatment-related grade 3 or worse adverse events occurred in 41 (68%) of 60 patients who received atezolizumab plus vemurafenib plus cobimetinib in the BRAFV600 mutation-positive cohort, the most common of which were lipase increased (15 [25%] of 60 patients) and blood creatine phosphokinase increased (11 [18%]). Eight (53%) of 15 patients treated with atezolizumab plus cobimetinib in the BRAFV600 wild-type cohort had treatment-related grade 3 or worse adverse events, most commonly anaemia (two [13%]) and dermatitis acneiform (two [13%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in 14 (23%) of 60 patients who received triplet therapy in the BRAFV600 mutation-positive cohort and two (13%) of 15 in the BRAFV600 wild-type cohort.

Hence, we performed a meta-analysis to identify AEs associated with regorafenib in patients with advanced solid tumors.METHODS: The databases of PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase and abstracts presented in American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meetings were searched for relevant publications from January 2004 to September 2017. Eligible studies were limited to prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluate the use of regorafenib in patients with advanced solid tumors. Incidence, relative risk (RR), and 95% CIs were calculated using a random or fixed effects model on the basis of the heterogeneity of the included studies.RESULTS: A total of 2,065 patients from six RCTs were included, and 1,340 of them received regorafenib and 725 received a placebo. Sixteen all-grade AEs and 15 high-grade AEs were investigated for their association with regorafenib. Results showed that hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR; 54%), diarrhea (33%), fatigue (32%), hypertension (31%), oral mucositis (28%), and anorexia (23%) were the most frequent clinical AEs.

Hypertension is a frequently occurring adverse effect caused by regorafenib regardless of previous treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors in almost all patients. We identified the risk factors associated with regorafenib-induced severe hypertension. Patients with mCRC (n \u003d 100) who received regorafenib were evaluated retrospectively. The primary endpoint was the evaluation of the risk factors for grade ≥ 3 hypertension. The association between pre-existing hypertension at baseline and grade ≥ 3 hypertension symptoms was also assessed. Patients with pre-existing hypertension at baseline accounted for 55% of the total patients. The starting doses of regorafenib were 160 mg (49.0% of patients), 120 mg (29.0%), and 80 mg (22.0%). The incidence of grade ≥ 3 hypertension was 30.0%. The median time to grade ≥ 3 symptom development was 7 days (range: 1-56 days). Additional antihypertensive treatment was administered to 83.6% of patients who developed hypertension. Logistic regression analyses revealed that baseline pre-existing hypertension complications and previous anti-VEGF treatment for ≥ 700 days were independent risk factors for grade ≥ 3 hypertension development. Further analyses revealed that pre-existing hypertension before anti-VEGF treatment (primary hypertension) was significantly related to the symptom development (adjusted odds ratio, 8.74; 95% confidence interval, 2.86-26.72; P \u003d 0.0001).",

Pooled analysis of cardiovascular adverse events was developed by relative risks (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with software STATA 13.0 and RevMan 5.3.RESULTS: Thirty studies including 3813 patients were fit into analysis. The incidences of cardiovascular events of all-grade were: hypertension, 36.8% (95% CI, 29.8%-43.8%), hemorrhage, 8.6% (95% CI, 3.2%-14%), thrombosis, 1.4% (95% CI, 0.1%-2.8%), and heart failure, 2.9% (95% CI, 0.3%-5.6%).

The study\u0027s primary aim was to assess safety, particularly unexpected clinically significant adverse drug reactions (ADRs). A Cox\u0027s proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the association between OS, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), and baseline characteristics.RESULTS: We evaluated 1,227 of 1,301 patients (enrolled from March 2013 to May 2015). ADRs occurred in 89.3% of patients (mostly within the first 4 weeks) and were a major reason for discontinuing treatment. The most frequent ADRs were HFSR, liver injury, and hypertension. The cumulative incidence of HFSR and liver injury was higher in patients who initially received 160 mg than in those who received ≤120 mg. The incidence of hypertension and fatigue was similar between groups. Median OS was 6.9 months (95% confidential interval, 6.4-7.4). OS was associated with early onset of HFSR and good performance status (PS) but not with the initial dose.CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this study were consistent with those of clinical trials. There were no new safety concerns. Regorafenib treatment would not be recommended for patients with higher PS.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Previous clinical trials demonstrated regorafenib improved overall survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who progress after standard chemotherapies. Because the eligibility criteria of the trials were restricted compared with a real-world setting, the data from the trials may not fully represent the profiles of regorafenib in clinical practice.

Regorafenib-induced hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) is a common side effect during treatment. The reported frequency of HFSR was 80% (grade 3: 28%) in the Japanese subpopulation in the CORRECT trial; however, more detailed data regarding HFSR in terms of onset and sites of susceptibility are unclear. Additionally, the risk factors for regorafenib-induced severe HFSR are unknown. The aim of this study was to compare HFSR between the hands and feet and identify preexisting risk factors for severe HFSR in Japanese patients receiving regorafenib. We retrospectively examined the onset and severity of HFSR on the hands and feet of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with regorafenib from May 2013 to October 2015 in the Cancer Institute Hospital of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research. In addition, we examined the possible association between preexisting clinical factors and severe HFSR. Our results showed that no significant difference in the incidence of HFSR of any grade was observed between the hands (71%) and feet (74%) (p \u003d 0.63). The incidence of grade 3 HFSR was more frequent on the feet (33%) than on the hands (8%) (p \u003c 0.01). The onset of grade 3 HFSR was earlier on the feet than on the hands (p \u003c 0.001). No preexisting risk factor was identified.",

It has been suggested that periostin is involved in allergic inflammation and fibrosis. However, the usefulness of serum periostin measurement in the assessment of airway inflammation and remodeling and management of asthmatic patients is still debated. We aimed to determine whether serum periostin levels reflect eosinophilic airway inflammation and airway remodeling in asthma.METHODS: We examined the relationship of serum periostin levels with clinical features, biomarkers for eosinophilic airway inflammation, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels and blood eosinophil counts, and pulmonary functions in 235 well-controlled asthmatic patients on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) treatment.RESULTS: Serum periostin levels were positively correlated with blood eosinophil counts (%) and age (r \u003d 0.36 and 0.23, respectively), and were negatively correlated with body weight and FEV1/FVC (%) (r \u003d -0.24 and - 0.23, respectively) in well-controlled asthmatic patients on ICS treatment (daily dose of 453 µg equivalent to fluticasone propionate). Blood eosinophil counts and serum periostin levels were similarly associated with increased FeNO levels (≥40 ppb) in the asthmatics. Serum periostin levels were better associated with fixed airflow limitation (FEV1/FVC ratio \u003c70%) than FeNO levels, blood eosinophil counts or total IgE levels in the asthmatics.

Serum and IS levels of periostin, TSLP, IL-4, and IL-13 were determined in 12 atopic asthmatics, 16 COPD sufferers, and 10 controls. We noticed a significantly higher IS periostin and TSLP concentration at protein and mRNA level in asthmatics compared to the two other groups; additionally, periostin and TSLP were correlated positively with IS eosinophil count. A strong positive correlation between IS periostin and TSLP protein levels (r \u003d 0.96) as well as mRNA expression level (r \u003d 0.95) was found in patients with asthma.

It has a potential role in identifying asthmatics who may be responsive to treatment with monoclonal antibody therapy directed against Type 2 cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-13, IL-4 receptor subunit-α and immunoglobulin E. The clinical utility of periostin measurements depends on better understanding of factors that may affect serum periostin levels, such as race. We aimed to identify the ranges of serum periostin in Chinese adults both with and without asthma, and compare them with those previously identified in Caucasian adults.METHODS: A two-centred cross-sectional study, recruiting 188 Chinese adults, aged 18 to 75 years. 120 participants had no history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 68 participants had a doctor\u0027s diagnosis of asthma and were on current treatment. Univariate comparisons of periostin by dichotomous variables were made using t-tests with logarithmic transformation as the distribution of periostin was skewed.RESULTS: In the Chinese non-asthma group, periostin levels were sex-, but not age-dependent, with females having higher periostin levels. The individual predicted (90% CI) reference range for periostin in females was 61.1 ng/ml (41.6 to 89.8) ng/ml and in males was 53.2 ng/ml (36.1 to 78.3) ng/ml.

However, the significance of periostin as a biomarker of local allergic inflammation in the nasal mucosa (NM) of patients with atopic bronchial asthma (BA) and allergic rhinitis (AR) is yet to be determined. The aim of the study was to determine the presence of periostin and evaluate its role as a non-invasive marker of allergic inflammation in the nasal secretions of children with atopic BA and AR.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 43 patients aged 4-17 years with atopic BA and AR, the NM was examined using nasal video-endoscopy and (if indicated) computed tomography; the amount of periostin in the nasal secretion was determined by the enzyme immunoassay.RESULTS: Exacerbation of AR was accompanied by a statistically significant increase in the level of periostin in the nasal secretion: up to 0.84 [0.06; 48.79] ng/mg, whereas in remission, that was 0.13 [0.00; 0.36] ng/mg; p\u003d0.04. This value increased progressively as the severity of AR increased from 0.16 [0.00; 0.36] ng/mg in the mild course to 0.20 [0.00; 9.03] ng/mg in AR of moderate severity, and to 10.70 [0.56; 769.20] ng/mg in most severe cases; p\u003d0.048. Hypertrophy or polyposis of the nasal and/or paranasal mucosa was detected in 34.9% (15/43) of the examined patients. The concentration of periostin in the nasal secretion was lower in children without NM hypertrophy: 0.18 [0.001; 4.30] ng/mg vs 0.78 [0.13; 162.10] ng/mg in patients with NM hypertrophy; the differences were close to statistically significant: p\u003d0.051. The level of nasal periostin depended on the clinical form of hypertrophy in the sinonasal mucosa, reaching 0.17 [0.00; 0.32] ng/mg in children with polyposis hyperplasia of NM and 21.6 [10.70; 1516.80] ng/mg - with hypertrophy of the NM in the medial surface of the concha; p\u003d0.02.CONCLUSION: Exacerbation and increased severity of AR in patients with atopic BA are accompanied by an increased l",

However, the role of periostin in arsenic-related asthma is unknown. Therefore, this study was designed to explore the associations of serum periostin levels with arsenic exposure and the features of asthma in 442 individuals in Bangladesh who participated in our previous study. Exposure levels of the participants were determined by measuring the arsenic concentrations in drinking water, hair, and nails through inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Periostin levels in serum were assessed by immunoassay. In this study, we found that serum periostin levels of the participants were increased with increasing exposure to arsenic. Notably, even the participants with 10.1-50 μg/L arsenic in drinking water had significantly higher levels of periostin than participants with \u003c10 μg/L of water arsenic. Elevated serum periostin levels were positively associated with serum levels of Th2 mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, and eotaxin. Each log increase in periostin levels was associated with approximately eight- and three-fold increases in the odds ratios (ORs) for reversible airway obstruction (RAO) and asthma symptoms, respectively. Additionally, causal mediation analyses revealed that arsenic exposure metrics had both direct and indirect (periostin-mediated) effects on the risk of RAO and asthma symptoms.",

We evaluated the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 6 (STAT6), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, and Akt after IL-13 stimulation. Furthermore, using ELISA, we evaluated the influence of several phosphorylation inhibitors on periostin production.RESULTS: Periostin mRNA expression increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner after IL-13 stimulation; periostin production was induced 24 and 48 h after stimulation. IL-13 stimulation induced the phosphorylation of STAT6, ERK1/2, and Akt. IL-13-induced periostin production was attenuated by inhibiting STAT6 phosphorylation and strongly suppressed by inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 phosphorylation or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) phosphorylation.CONCLUSIONS: BSM cells produced periostin after IL-13 stimulation, via the J",

        "Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, often associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The three main clinical variants of BL are endemic, sporadic, and immunodeficiency-associated. The endemic variant is most common in equatorial Africa, where malaria is prevalent, and nearly all cases are EBV-positive. The sporadic variant is more common in North America and Europe, with a male-to-female ratio of 3:1 and approximately 20-30% of cases are EBV-positive. The immunodeficiency-associated variant is often seen in HIV-infected individuals and post-transplant patients, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1 and a high prevalence of EBV infection (25-40%).\n\nThe primary oncogenic event in BL is the dysregulation of the c-myc gene by one of three chromosomal translocations, which place the myc gene under the control of an immunoglobulin gene enhancer. This translocation is found in 90% of BL cases. Additional mutations, such as TP53, ARF, USP7, and SIN3A mutations, are necessary for lymphoma development.\n\nEBV infection contributes to BL pathogenesis by promoting cellular growth through modification of normal signaling pathways and limiting apoptosis in cells with c-myc translocations. Malaria infection can further contribute to the development of endemic BL by causing genomic instability and promoting B-cell proliferation.\n\nDiagnosis of BL involves the detection of clonal rearrangements of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes and characteristic histopathological features. Treatment typically includes chemotherapy regimens, such as GMALL-B-ALL/NHL2002, modified Magrath, COPADM, hyper-CVAD, and CALGB 8811, which can be associated with rituximab. Prognosis is generally better for children, with a 90% overall cure rate in developed countries. However, outcomes are worse for adults, especially in cases of failed initial treatment or return of the disease.\n\nIn summary, EBV infection is a key factor in the pathogenesis of BL, particularly in the endemic variant, and malaria infection can further contribute to its development. The primary oncogenic event is the dysregulation of the c-myc gene, and additional mutations are necessary for lymphoma development. Diagnosis is based on the detection of clonal rearrangements of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes and characteristic histopathological features, and treatment typically includes chemotherapy regimens.",
        "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is strongly associated with endemic Burkitt lymphoma (BL), especially in Africa. Evidence suggests EBV plays a role in the pathogenesis of endemic BL through several potential mechanisms:\n\n1. EBV may contribute to deregulation of the c-MYC oncogene via chromosomal translocation, a hallmark of BL tumors. \n\n2. Malaria (P. falciparum) infection appears to work together with EBV in endemic BL. Malaria may induce EBV reactivation and expansion of EBV-infected B cells, increasing chances of c-MYC translocation. Malaria may also impair EBV-specific T-cell immunity.\n\n3. Endemic BL shows a lower mutation burden than sporadic BL, suggesting EBV drives an alternative, possibly epigenetic process of transformation in endemic cases.\n\nIn summary, while EBV infection alone is not sufficient to cause endemic BL, evidence indicates it contributes to pathogenesis through interactions with malaria, deregulation of c-MYC, and epigenetic mechanisms. The virus appears necessary but not solely responsible for development of endemic Burkitt lymphoma."

        "The etiology of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most serious form of brain cancer, remains obscure, although it has been proposed that cancer risk is a function of random polymerase errors that occur during stem cell division and the resulting mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. In particular, the most commonly affected tumor suppressor genes in GBM are p53, PTEN, p16/CDKN2, and RB, leading to activation of the PI3K/Akt and Ras/MAPK pathways, which provide targets for therapy.",
        "Based on the information provided, the most commonly affected tumor suppressor genes in glioblastoma are:\n\n1. CDKN2A/p16 - Homozygous deletions or mutations of p16 are very frequent in glioblastoma, occurring in 64-86% of cases. Loss of p16 is often accompanied by loss of the related p14ARF and p15 genes.\n\n2. RB (Retinoblastoma) - Alterations in RB are also common, though less frequent than p16. RB and p16 alterations tend to be mutually exclusive.\n\n3. PTEN - Mutations or deletions of PTEN occur in approximately 30-73% of glioblastomas, making it one of the most commonly altered genes after EGFR amplification.\n\n4. TP53 - p53 mutations are also highly prevalent, seen in over 76% of glioblastoma cell lines.\n\nIn summary, inactivation of the p16-CDK4/cyclin D-RB pathway and PTEN/PI3K signaling are key molecular events in the pathogenesis of most glioblastomas. Mutations in these critical tumor suppressors, along with EGFR activation, drive the malignant phenotype.",
        "Based on the provided information, the most commonly mutated or deleted tumor suppressor genes in glioblastoma are:\n\n1. TP53 (p53): Mutated in over 76% of glioblastoma cell lines. Loss of p53 leads to genomic instability and uncontrolled cell growth.\n\n2. PTEN: Mutated in approximately 30-73% of glioblastomas. PTEN loss leads to overactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR growth-promoting pathway.\n\n3. CDKN2A (p16 and p14ARF): Homozygous deletions of CDKN2A, encoding the p16 and p14ARF cell cycle inhibitors, are found in 34-65% of glioblastomas. This allows uncontrolled cell cycle progression.\n\n4. RB1: Alterations in the retinoblastoma (RB1) pathway are common, with RB1 itself mutated in some cases. The p16-CDK4/cyclin D1-RB pathway is inactivated in the vast majority of glioblastomas.\n\nOther less commonly affected tumor suppressors include NF1 and CDKN2B (p15).\n\nIn summary, TP53, PTEN, CDKN2A, and RB1 are the most frequently mutated or deleted tumor suppressor genes in glioblastoma, leading to the loss of critical cell cycle control and growth regulation."

Predictive information for anti-EGFR treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) was observed, but data for other agents is limited.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Ligand mRNA expression; RAS, BRAF, PIK3CA mutations; and EGFR expression were assessed by qRT-PCR, pyrosequencing, and IHC, respectively, in mCRC tumor tissue of patients participating in the randomized controlled trials FIRE-1, CIOX, and FIRE-3. Normalized mRNA expression was dichotomized using median and third quartile. Overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method including univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Penalized spline regression analysis tested interaction of mRNA expression and outcome.RESULTS: Of 688 patients with available material, high AREG expression was detected in 343 (\u003emedian) and 172 (\u003e3rd quartile) patients. High AREG expression was associated with significantly higher OS [26.2 vs. 21.5 months, HR \u003d 0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.68-0.94; P \u003d 0.007], PFS (10.0 vs. 8.1 months, HR \u003d 0.74; 95% CI, 0.63-0.86; P \u003d 0.001), and objective response rate (63.1% vs. 51.6%, P \u003d 0.004) compared to low expression at both threshold values.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of baseline plasma AREG levels in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) on treatment outcome with palliative first-line cetuximab + FOLFIRI chemotherapy. Chemotherapy outcomes were analyzed based on baseline plasma AREG levels. The clinical findings were further validated using an in vitro model of CRC. Among 35 patients, the progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly inferior in patients with high AREG than in those with low AREG levels: 10.9 vs. 24.2 months, respectively (p \u003d 0.008). However, after failure of first-line chemotherapy, AREG levels were associated with neither PFS (4.8 vs. 11.6 months; p \u003d 0.215) nor overall survival (8.4 vs. 13.3 months; p \u003d 0.975).

Archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue was analyzed for AREG and EREG IHC in six regional laboratories using previously developed artificial intelligence technologies.

Second, the EGFR amplification and distinct polymorphisms may have roles in identifying patients for initial anti-EGFR mAbs therapy, while rare EGFR mutations have limited predictive values.

        "Epiregulin (EREG) and Amphiregulin (AREG) are ligands of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), which is a target for cancer therapy. In colorectal cancer, high expression levels of EREG and AREG have been identified as predictive biomarkers for response to EGFR inhibitors such as cetuximab and panitumumab. Patients with high tumor expression of these ligands tend to have improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) when treated with EGFR inhibitors, compared to those with low expression levels. This suggests that EREG and AREG play a crucial role in the use of EGFR inhibitors for colorectal cancer, as their expression may help identify patients most likely to benefit from these therapies.",
        "Amphiregulin and epiregulin were shown to play critical roles in the response to EGFR inhibitors in colorectal cancer; this role is independent of KRAS mutations. When both epiregulin and amphiregulin expression were detected, the response to EGFR inhibitors increased significantly.",
        "Epiregulin (EREG) and amphiregulin (AREG) are ligands of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and their overexpression may indicate EGFR dependency in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), regardless of tumor sidedness. High AREG/EREG expression is associated with sensitivity to EGFR blockade, particularly in patients with right-sided tumors and a lack of genomic drivers of primary resistance beyond RAS and BRAF mutations. The expression of AREG and EREG is positively correlated with a response to EGFR-targeted therapies in colorectal cancer. Gene-body methylation sites, which show a strong inverse correlation with AREG and EREG gene expression, have been identified in cell lines and human colorectal cancer samples. Treatment of colorectal cancer cells with 5-aza-2\u0027-desoxycytidine, a demethylating agent, results in decreased methylation and increased AREG and EREG gene expression. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) overexpression in colon cancer cells has been shown to upregulate EGFR signaling, secrete EGFR ligands such as AREG, and promote tumor growth. FGFR4 overexpression also reduces cetuximab-induced cytotoxicity, while the combination of an FGFR4 inhibitor and cetuximab has shown profound antitumor effects. Clinically, there is a positive correlation between FGFR4 and AREG expression in tumor tissue, but not in normal tissue, from colon cancer patients. A study was conducted to investigate the effects of baseline plasma AREG levels in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF wild-type metastatic CRC on treatment outcome with palliative first-line cetuximab + FOLFIRI chemotherapy. The results showed that high baseline plasma AREG levels were significantly associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with cetuximab-based therapy. Additionally, in vitro studies using CRC cell lines sensitive to cetuximab showed that AREG decreased the anti-proliferative effect of cetuximab via AKT and ERK activation. However, after acquiring cetuximab resistance, AREG did not increase colony formation or activate AKT and ERK after cetuximab treatment.

First discovered as an essential component of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae tRNA splicing machinery, Tpt1 is widely distributed in nature, including in taxa that have no yeast-like RNA splicing system. Here we characterize the RslTpt1 protein from the bacterium Runella slithyformis, in which Tpt1 is encoded within a putative RNA repair gene cluster. We find that (i) expression of RslTpt1 in yeast complements a lethal tpt1Δ knockout, and (ii) purified recombinant RslTpt1 is a bona fide NAD+-dependent 2\u0027-phosphotransferase capable of completely removing an internal 2\u0027-phosphate from synthetic RNAs. The in vivo activity of RslTpt1 is abolished by alanine substitutions for conserved amino acids Arg16, His17, Arg64, and Arg119. The R64A, R119A, and H17A mutants accumulate high levels of a 2\u0027-phospho-ADP-ribosylated RNA reaction intermediate (2\u0027-P-ADPR, evanescent in the wild-type RslTpt1 reaction), which is converted slowly to a 2\u0027-OH RNA product. The R16A mutant is 300-fold slower than wild-type RslTpt1 in forming the 2\u0027-P-ADPR intermediate. Whereas wild-type RsTpt1 rapidly converts the isolated 2\u0027-P-ADPR intermediate to 2\u0027-OH product in the absence of NAD+, the H17A, R119A, R64A, and R16A mutant are slower by factors of 3, 33, 210, and 710, respectively.",

While the mechanism of nucleotide selection and polymerization is well understood, it remains a mystery why bacterial and eukaryotic enzymes exhibit an unexpected and surprisingly low tRNA substrate affinity while they efficiently catalyze the CCA-addition. To get insights into the evolution of this high-fidelity RNA synthesis, the reconstruction and characterization of ancestral enzymes is a versatile tool. Here, we investigate a reconstructed candidate of a 2 billion years old CCA-adding enzyme from Gammaproteobacteria and compare it to the corresponding modern enzyme of Escherichia coli. We show that the ancestral candidate catalyzes an error-free CCA-addition, but has a much higher tRNA affinity compared with the extant enzyme. The consequence of this increased substrate binding is an enhanced reverse reaction, where the enzyme removes the CCA end from the mature tRNA. As a result, the ancestral candidate exhibits a lower catalytic efficiency in vitro as well as in vivo.",

Other clinical features found in children include sensorineural deafness, cerebellar atrophy, brittle hair, partial villous atrophy and nephrocalcinosis. Whole exome sequencing and bioinformatic filtering were utilised to identify recessive compound heterozygous TRNT1 mutations (missense mutation c.668T\u003eC, p.Ile223Thr and a novel splice mutation c.342+5G\u003eT) segregating with disease in the first family. The second family was found to have a homozygous TRNT1 mutation (c.569G\u003eT), p.Arg190Ile, (previously published). We found normal mitochondrial translation products using passage matched controls and functional perturbation of 3\u0027 CCA addition to mitochondrial tRNAs (tRNA(Cys), tRNA(LeuUUR) and tRNA(His)) in fibroblasts from two patients, demonstrating a pathomechanism affecting the CCA addition to mt-tRNAs. Acute management of these patients included transfusion for anaemia, fluid and electrolyte replacement and immunoglobulin therapy. We also describe three-year follow-up findings after treatment by bone marrow transplantation in one patient, with resolution of fever and reversal of the abnormal metabolic profile.CONCLUSIONS: Our report highlights that TRNT1 mutations cause a spectrum of disease ranging from a childhood-onset complex disease with manifestations in most organs to an adult-onset isolated re",

Immunophenotyping revealed increased CD8+ T cells, CD4+ terminally differentiated effector memory helper T lymphocytes (CD4 TEMRA), and CD4+ effector memory lymphocytes (CD4 EM). Analysis of CD4+ T subsets identified decreased T follicular helper cells (Tfh) with a biased phenotype to Th2-like cells. The patient also showed a lower percentage of switched memory B (smB) cells. Additionally, defects in the cytotoxicity of the patient\u0027s NK and γδT cells were shown by CD107alpha expression.",

CRC is characterised by significant dysbiosis including reduced short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria. Recent findings suggest that exercise can modify the gut microbiota, and these changes are inverse to the changes seen with CRC; however, this exercise-microbiota interaction is currently understudied in CRC.

We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of a 12-week home-based exercise program on fasting insulin, adipocytokines, and physical function in CRC survivors.METHODS: One hundred and twenty-three stage II-III CRC patients were randomly assigned to either a home-based exercise (n\u003d62) or standard care control group (n\u003d61) for 12weeks. Home-based exercise consisted of aerobic and resistance training, with a goal of obtaining ≥18 metabolic equivalent task (MET)-h/wk. Participants in the exercise group were instructed to participate in \u003e18MET-h/wk. of aerobic and resistance exercise while the participants in the control group were asked to maintain their usual daily activity. The primary outcome was fasting insulin levels. Secondary outcomes were adiponectin, TNF-α levels and 6min walk distance from baseline to post-intervention.RESULTS: After the 12-weeks, moderate-vigorous physical activity participation increased from 9.1±14.7MET-h/wk. to 26.6±21.7MET-h/wk. in the exercise group, with no change in the control group (p\u003c0.01 for group and time interaction).

Exercise is also an effective therapeutic modality against colorectal cancer. However, the review focused on the effects of exercise in preventing, treating, and alleviating the adverse effects of conventional therapeutic options in colorectal cancer. A database search for randomized, controlled, exercise trials involving individuals with colorectal cancer, published before January 1, 2020, was conducted. Safety, feasibility, and effect data were abstracted, and risk difference and standardized mean differences were calculated to compare safety and effects between exercise and usual care. Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess whether outcomes differed by exercise mode, duration, supervision, and treatment. The review found that there was no difference in adverse event risk between exercise and usual care. Significant effects of exercise compared to usual care were observed for quality of life, fatigue, aerobic fitness, upper-body strength, depression, sleep, and reduced body fat. Subgroup analyses suggested larger benefits for supervised interventions, interventions during chemotherapy, and interventions of 12 weeks or longer.",

Several studies have found that regular physical activity after diagnosis of stage I-III colorectal cancer is associated with lower cancer recurrence rates and improved disease-free and overall survival compared to inactive patients. The protective effect appears to be dose-dependent, with higher levels of physical activity providing greater reductions in recurrence and mortality risk. The mechanism may involve prevention, rather than just delay, of cancer recurrence in some patients. Therefore, recreational physical activity is recommended for colorectal cancer survivors to reduce the risk of recurrence and improve survival outcomes.",

One of the major oxysterols currently of interest is 7-ketocholesterol (7K) and it has been suggested that the diet is an important source of this oxysterol. This investigation tested the hypothesis that 7K, delivered in a physiologically relevant vehicle, chylomicron remnant-like emulsion (CMR), would be metabolised and excreted by mice in a similar manner and to a similar extent as previously observed in rats when delivered in a chemically modified lipoprotein, acetylated low-density lipoprotein (acLDL). Indeed, the metabolism of 14C-7K delivered in CMR mirrored that of acLDL and was much more rapid than (3)H-cholesterol delivered simultaneously. The 7K-derived (14)C was cleared from the liver, appeared in the intestine and was excreted in the faeces. A substantial proportion of the 7K-derived (14)C in the intestine and faeces was aqueous-soluble, indicating metabolism to polar products, presumably bile acids. Moreover, while cholesterol-derived (3)H increased in the aorta, (14)C appeared transiently and there was no observable accumulation within 24 h. The data confirm our previous findings of rapid hepatic metabolism of 7K when delivered in acLDL and demonstrate that 7K delivered in a vehicle of dietary significance is similarly metabolised and excreted.",

However, less is known about the potential atherogenicity of oxidised plant sterols (oxyphytosterols). In the present study, the atherogenicity of a mixture of oxyphytosterols was examined by feeding female LDL receptor-deficient (LDLR+/ -) mice for 35 weeks a control diet (atherogenic high-fat diet; n 9), an oxysterol diet (control diet+0·025 % (w/w) oxysterols; n 12) or an oxyphytosterol diet (control diet+0·025 % (w/w) oxyphytosterols; n 12). In the LDLR+/ - mice, serum levels of cholesterol, lipoprotein profiles, cholesterol exposure and inflammatory markers at the end of the experiment were comparable between the three diet groups. Nevertheless, the proportion of severe atherosclerotic lesions was significantly higher after oxysterol (41 %; P\u003d 0·004) and oxyphytosterol (34 %; P\u003d 0·011) diet consumption than after control diet consumption (26 %).

Ileoscopy showed complete loss of normal intestinal anatomic landmarks and ulcerated mucosa. Graft biopsies showed ulceration and granulation tissue with severe architectural distortion consistent with severe intestinal graft rejection.

Since 1985, more than 300 small-bowel grafts have been performed, involving the isolated small bowel with or without the colon (45%), the liver + small bowel (40%) or several organs (15%). 2/3 of recipients were under 20 years of age, and indications were short-bowel syndrome (64%), severe intractable diarrhea (13%), abdominal cancer (13%), or chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction syndrome (8%). 51% of patients survived \u003e 2 years after the graft. Patient and graft survival depends on the type of immunosuppression, i.e. Cyclosporine or FK 506. The results must be interpreted carefully as they represent the first experience in numerous centers using different immuno-suppressive protocols, without any randomization. The results from the largest of these centers more closely reflect the current situation and may exceed a 70% 2-year survival rate. Functional grafts lead to gastrointestinal autonomy (weaning of PN) while maintaining satisfactory nutritional status and normal growth in childhood. Intestinal transplantation is theoretically indicated for all patients permanently or persistently dependent on PN. However, as PN is generally well tolerated, even for long periods, each indication for transplantation must be carefully weighed up in terms of the iatrogenic risk and quality of life. When PN has reached its limits, especially those associated with vascular, infectious, hepatic or metabolic complications, intestinal transplantation must be undertaken.",

All but one had short bowel syndrome.RESULTS: The 1-year actuarial patient and graft survival rates for recipients of liver and small bowel transplants were 76% and 61%, respectively. Eight of 13 patients who received liver and small bowel transplants remain alive at the time of this writing, with a mean length of follow-up of 263 (range, 7 to 1223) days. Six patients are currently free of total parenteral nutrition. All three patients receiving isolated intestinal transplants are alive and free of parenteral nutrition.

        "No. Bowel transplantation is extremely rarely performed.",
        "Bowel transplantation, also known as intestinal transplantation, is not commonly performed in patients with severe gastrointestinal diseases. It is typically reserved for individuals with intestinal failure, which is a condition where the intestines are unable to absorb enough nutrients, water, and electrolytes to sustain life. The most common cause of intestinal failure is short bowel syndrome, which occurs when a large portion of the small intestine is surgically removed, leaving less than 2 meters (6.6 feet) of the small intestine remaining. However, intestinal transplantation is a complex procedure with a mixed success rate and a high postoperative mortality rate. Therefore, it is not a common treatment option for patients with severe gastrointestinal diseases.",
        "No, bowel transplantation is not commonly performed in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, because of the risks and complexity of the surgery, the need for lifelong immunosuppression, and the availability of alternative treatments.",
        "No, bowel transplantation is not commonly performed in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease. The evidence suggests:\n\n- Small bowel transplant is still associated with significant mortality and morbidity. The outcomes are inferior to total parenteral nutrition (TPN).\n- This procedure should only be used when TPN is no longer feasible. \n- Long-term survival remains higher on home parenteral nutrition than with intestinal transplantation.\n- The experience in small bowel transplant is still limited.\n- 5-year survival rate after transplant does not exceed 50%. \n- The risks and long-term adverse effects of immunosuppression limit small bowel transplantation only to patients with severe complications of TPN therapy.\n- It is reserved for patients with irreversible intestinal failure who have a poor prognosis on parenteral nutrition.\n\nSo while intestinal transplantation is becoming more viable for select patients with intestinal failure, it remains an uncommon procedure due to high risks and generally inferior outcomes compared to parenteral nutrition. It is not routinely performed in most patients with severe gastrointestinal disease."

However, large-scale and reliable population-based data that demonstrate this association are lacking. This study aims to examine the association between outpatient treatment with fluoroquinolones or macrolides and MG-related hospitalization.METHODS: A retrospective cohort study consisting of adult MG patients was conducted using a large de-identified healthcare claims database. Antibiotic prescription claims were identified, and MG-related hospitalizations were assessed at 15, 30, and 90 days after the date of prescription. We used mixed effects survival regression with log-logistic distribution and independent covariance matrix to estimate odds ratios (ORs) of hospitalization for each potentially exacerbating antibiotic using beta-lactam as the reference and adjusting for covariates.RESULTS: Among 1556 MG patients receiving 894 fluoroquinolone prescriptions, 729 macrolide prescriptions, and 1608 beta-lactam prescriptions during the study period, there was no difference in 15, 30, or 90-day odds of MG-related hospitalization between fluoroquinolone or macrolide users compared to prescribed beta-lactams. However, estimates were higher for fluoroquinolones than macrolides, even after covariate adjustment (adjusted OR [aOR] 4.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-38.57 for fluoroquinolones and OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32-0.97 for mac",

However, many medications that have been reported to cause exacerbations of MG are among the top 200 most prescribed drugs. The purpose of this therapeutic update is to provide pharmacists with a general understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of MG and describe common medications with the potential to cause new onset or acute worsening of this disease.SUMMARY: MG is an autoimmune disorder in which patients develop autoantibodies to a component of the neuromuscular junction, most frequently the acetylcholine receptor, resulting in impairment of skeletal muscle contraction. Although MG is not highly prevalent, there are up to 60,000 individuals with MG in the US, making it a disease that many pharmacists will likely encounter at least once in their career. Immunosuppressant medications and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are the mainstays of treatment, although there is limited evidence as to which agents are most efficacious. Medications that activate the immune system, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, may cause new onset of disease, while those with actions on the neuromuscular junction, such as macrolides and fluoroquinolones, can cause acute worsening of disease.CONCLUSION: MG, although not frequently covered in pharmacy school curricula, is a disease state for which it is not uncommon for pharmacists to provide care.

Outcomes among IHC-detected BRAF V600E mCRC (BRAF IHC) were compared with patients with next-generation sequencing (NGS)-identified BRAF V600E-mutated mCRC from two institutions (BRAF NGS) with patients spanning from 2004 to 2018.RESULTS: All-stage population prevalence of BRAF V600E was 12.5% (238/1,898) and did not differ between early and metastatic stages (P \u003d 0.094). Prevalence among mCRC was 10.6% (61/575), of whom 51 (83.6%) were referred to oncology and 26 (42.6%) had NGS testing. BRAF IHC had worse median overall survival (mOS) than BRAF NGS [5.5 vs. 20.4 months; HR, 2.90; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.89-4.45; P \u003c 0.0001], which persisted in multivariate analysis (P \u003c 0.0001). Across a combined NGS and IHC cohort, BRAF V600E tumors with deficient MMR showed worse mOS compared with MMR proficient tumors (8.9 vs. 17.2 months; HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 0.96-2.27; P \u003d 0.043). In this combined cohort, first-line progression-free survival was 5.9 months, with minimal differences between regimens.

The present work aimed to describe the clinicopathological characteristics and clinical outcome of the BRAF non-V600E mutant-type in colorectal cancer (CRC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: CRC samples from 111 Stage IV patients were analyzed for somatic mutations using a 415-gene comprehensive genomic sequencing panel. Patients were classified according to BRAF status as wild-type, V600E mutant-type, or non-V600E mutant-type. Differences between clinicopathological characteristics and genetic alterations were analyzed among the three groups. Overall survival (OS) and the response to anti-EGFR therapy were also analyzed.RESULTS: Comprehensive genomic sequencing revealed that 98 patients (88%), 7 patients (6%), and 6 patients (6%) were wild-type, V600E mutant-type, and non-V600E mutant-type, respectively. Non-V600E mutant-type tumors were frequently left-sided (83%), while V600E mutant-type tumors were frequently right-sided (86%; P \u003d 0.025).

Mutations in 254 patients were evaluated using the direct sequencing method to check for concordance.RESULTS: The frequency of MSI-H was 9.3 % (44/472), and BRAF V600E mutation was detected immunohistochemically in 8.7 % patients (41/472).

It was recently shown that alternative splicing underlies the formation of circular RNAs (circRNA) arising from the Titin (TTN) gene. Since the main mechanism by which circRNAs are formed is still unclear, we hypothesized that alternative splicing, and in particular exon skipping, is a major driver of circRNA production. We performed RNA sequencing on human and mouse hearts, mapped alternative splicing events, and overlaid these with expressed circRNAs at exon-level resolution. In addition, we performed RNA sequencing on hearts of Rbm20 KO mice to address how important Rbm20-mediated alternative splicing is in the production of cardiac circRNAs. In human and mouse hearts, we show that cardiac circRNAs are mostly (∼90%) produced from constitutive exons and less (∼10%) from alternatively spliced exons. In Rbm20 KO hearts, we identified 38 differentially expressed circRNAs of which 12 were produced from the Ttn gene. Even though Ttn appeared the most prominent target of Rbm20 for circularization, we also detected Rbm20-dependent circRNAs arising from other genes including Fan1, Stk39, Xdh, Bcl2l13, and Sorbs1 Interestingly, only Ttn circRNAs seemed to arise from Rbm20-mediated skipped exons.",

Mezigdomide is a novel cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase modulator with potent antiproliferative and tumoricidal activity in preclinical models of multiple myeloma, including those resistant to lenalidomide and pomalidomide.METHODS: In this phase 1-2 study, we administered oral mezigdomide in combination with dexamethasone to patients with relapsed and refractory myeloma. The primary objectives of phase 1 (dose-escalation cohort) were to assess safety and pharmacokinetics and to identify the dose and schedule for phase 2. In phase 2 (dose-expansion cohort), objectives included the assessment of the overall response (partial response or better), safety, and efficacy of mezigdomide plus dexamethasone at the dose and schedule determined in phase 1.RESULTS: In phase 1, a total of 77 patients were enrolled in the study. The most common dose-limiting toxic effects were neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. On the basis of the phase 1 findings, investigators determined the recommended phase 2 dose of mezigdomide to be 1.0 mg, given once daily in combination with dexamethasone for 21 days, followed by 7 days off, in each 28-day cycle. In phase 2, a total of 101 patients received the dose identified in phase 1 in the same schedule. All patients in the dose-expansion cohort had triple-class-refractory multiple myeloma, 30 patients (30%) had received previous anti-B-cell maturation antigen (anti-BCMA) therapy, and 40 (40%) had plasmacytomas. The most common adverse events, almost all of which proved to be reversible, included neutropenia (in 77% of the patients) and infection (in 65%; grade 3, 29%; grade 4, 6%). No unexpected toxic effects were encountered. An overall response occurred in 41% of the patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 31 to 51), the median duration of response was 7.6 months (95% CI, 5.4 to 9.5; data not mature), and the median progression-free survival was 4.4 months (95% CI, 3.0 to 5.5), with a median follow-up of 7.5 ",

These benefits appear to be restricted to patients aged 50 and above. However, among the population aged \u003c 50, CRC incidence and mortality rates are significantly rising. The clinical benefit of treatment in this population still is a matter of debate. We aim to compare the clinical outcome between patients aged 50 and younger. Methods In this retrospective, observational study, we analyzed data from 1077 patients treated for mCRC at three cancer centers in Austria from January 2005 to December 2019. Patients were divided into two groups based on age at diagnosis: \u003c50 years (eo-CRC) and \u003e50 years (regular-onset CRC, ro-CRC). Propensity score matching was used to control for potential biases, and survival outcomes were compared between the two groups. Results The differences in tumor characteristics between eo-CRC and ro-CRC in the overall population were primarily related to tumor sidedness and disease-free survival following intended curative resection. Our data show that eo-CRC patients underwent metastases resection more often and received significantly more lines of treatment in the palliative setting.",

One patient was ineligible and excluded from analysis. Nine patients did not fulfill the inclusion criteria and five patients refused treatment allocation; these patients were not excluded from the study population so as not to introduce bias.

However, the articles mention that the five-year survival rate in the United States was around 65% in 2014, and the individual likelihood of survival depends on factors such as the stage of the cancer, the ability to remove the cancer surgically, and the person\u0027s overall health. The articles also discuss various treatment options for colorectal cancer, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy, as well as the importance of early detection and prevention through lifestyle changes and regular screenings.\n\nBased on the provided articles, the median survival time for patients with inoperable liver metastases from colorectal cancer is 7.4 to 11 months. Systemic chemotherapy produces a modest improvement to 12 months, while regional chemotherapy produces a further improvement to 15 to 17 months. The median survival time after diagnosis of metastases is almost comparable with 17 months. The median survival time was 6 months in the entire cohort, 16 months, 7.5 months, 8.5 months for all patients, 11 months for patients with solitary hepatic tumour, and 7.5 months for those with multiple tumours. Combined with regimens such as FOLFOX or FOLFIRI, median survival rates have been increased to an average of 23 months.

Here we elucidate the interactions between various proteins involved in mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). An in vitro mTORC1 kinase assay approach was used to probe the role of the mTORC1 component Raptor and revealed that certain Raptor mutations disrupt binding to eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and prevent its subsequent phosphorylation by mTOR. Interestingly, we show that a point mutation in the highly conserved Raptor RNC domain still allows binding to mTOR but prevents Raptor association and mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, indicating that this Raptor domain facilitates substrate recognition by mTORC1. This Raptor RNC domain mutant also dominantly inhibits mTORC1 signalling to 4E-BP1, S6K1 and HIF1alpha in vivo. We further characterise the functions of the mTORC1 signalling (TOS) and RAIP motifs of 4E-BP1, which are involved in substrate recognition by Raptor and phosphorylation by mTORC1. We show that an mTOR mutant, L1460P, responds to insulin even in nutrient-deprived conditions and is resistant to inhibition by inactive RagB-RagC heterodimers that mimic nutrient withdrawal suggesting that this region of mTOR is involved in sensing the permissive amino acid input. We found that FKBP38 inhibits mTOR(L1460P), while the mTOR(E2419K) kinase domain mutant was resistant to FKBP38 inhibition. Finally, we show that activation of mTORC1 by both Rheb and RhebL1 is impaired by FKBP38. Our work demonstrates the value of an in vitro mTORC1 kinase assay to characterise cell signalling components of mTORC1 involved in recognition and phosphotransfer to mTORC1 substrates.",

While diverse stimuli regulate mTORC1 signaling, the direct molecular mechanisms by which mTORC1 senses and responds to these signals remain poorly defined. Here we investigated the role of mTOR phosphorylation in mTORC1 function. By employing mass spectrometry and phospho-specific antibodies, we demonstrated novel phosphorylation on S2159 and T2164 within the mTOR kinase domain. Mutational analysis of these phosphorylation sites indicates that dual S2159/T2164 phosphorylation cooperatively promotes mTORC1 signaling to S6K1 and 4EBP1. Mechanistically, S2159/T2164 phosphorylation modulates the mTOR-raptor and raptor-PRAS40 interactions and augments mTORC1-associated mTOR S2481 autophosphorylation. Moreover, mTOR S2159/T2164 phosphorylation promotes cell growth and cell cycle progression.",

We demonstrate that protein kinase N (PKN) facilitates mTORC1 signalling by repressing PI3KC2-β-mediated phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate synthesis downstream of mTORC2. Active PKN2 phosphorylates PI3KC2-β to trigger PI3KC2-β complex formation with inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins.

Activated mTORC1 kinase up-regulates protein synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation. By contrast, mTORC2 is resistant to rapamycin.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which mTOR controls cell proliferation remain elusive. Here we show that the FoxO3a transcription factor is coordinately regulated by mTORC1 and mTORC2, and plays a crucial role in controlling cell proliferation. To dissect mTOR signaling, mTORC1 was specifically inactivated by depleting p18, an essential anchor of mTORC1 on lysosomes. mTORC1 inactivation caused a marked retardation of cell proliferation, which was associated with upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs). Although Akt was activated by mTORC1 inactivation, FoxO3a was upregulated via an epigenetic mechanism and hypophosphorylated at Ser314, which resulted in its nuclear accumulation. Consistently, mTORC1 inactivation induced downregulation of serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1), the kinase responsible for Ser314 phosphorylation. Expression of FoxO3a mutated at Ser314 suppressed cell proliferation by inducing CDKI expression. SGK1 overexpression suppressed CDKI expression in p18-deficient cells, whereas SGK1 knockdown induced CDKI expression in wild-type cells, resulting in the suppression of cell proliferation.",

Previously we found that activation of mTOR kinase in response to insulin was associated with increased 4EBP1 binding to raptor. Here we identify prolinerich Akt substrate 40 (PRAS40) as a binding partner for mTORC1. A putative TOR signaling motif, FVMDE, is identified in PRAS40 and shown to be required for interaction with raptor. Insulin stimulation markedly decreases the level of PRAS40 bound by mTORC1. Recombinant PRAS40 inhibits mTORC1 kinase activity in vivo and in vitro, and this inhibition depends on PRAS40 association with raptor. Furthermore, decreasing PRAS40 expression by short hairpin RNA enhances 4E-BP1 binding to raptor, and recombinant PRAS40 competes with 4E-BP1 binding to raptor.",

        "No, there is no strong evidence to suggest that statin use is associated with a higher risk of dementia. In fact, some studies have found that statin use may be linked to a reduced risk of dementia, particularly among patients with stroke. However, it\u0027s important to note that the relationship between statins and dementia risk is complex and may depend on various factors such as the type and duration of statin use, age, sex, and other health conditions. Further research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and risks of statin use in relation to dementia.",
        "According to a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies, statin use is not associated with a higher risk of dementia or Alzheimer\u0027s disease. In fact, the study found that statin use was associated with a decreased risk of both dementia and Alzheimer\u0027s disease. This reduction in risk was similar for both lipophilic and hydrophilic statins, but high-potency statins showed a greater efficacy in reducing dementia risk compared to low-potency statins. These findings suggest that statin treatment does not carry a neurocognitive risk and may even have a potential favorable role in reducing the risk of dementia. However, randomized clinical trials are needed to further explore this potential neuroprotective effect."

Here we describe the molecular engineering and the biological and pharmacological properties of insulin icodec.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A number of in vitro assays measuring receptor binding, intracellular signaling as well as cellular metabolic and mitogenic responses were used to characterize the biological properties of insulin icodec. To evaluate the pharmacological properties of insulin icodec in individuals with type 2 diabetes, a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, multiple-dose, dose escalation trial was conducted.RESULTS: The long half-life of insulin icodec was achieved by introducing modifications to the insulin molecule aiming to obtain a safe, albumin-bound circulating depot of insulin icodec, providing protracted insulin action and clearance. Addition of a C20 fatty diacid-containing side chain imparts strong, reversible albumin binding, while three amino acid substitutions (A14E, B16H and B25H) provide molecular stability and contribute to attenuating insulin receptor (IR) bindin",

Frequent blood sampling to assess total serum icodec concentration (ie, albumin-bound and unbound) occurred from first icodec dose until 35 days after last dose. Icodec trough concentrations following initiation of once-weekly dosing were predicted by pharmacokinetic modelling. During the final 3 weeks of icodec treatment, while at steady state, the icodec glucose-lowering effect was assessed in three glucose clamps (target 7.5 mmol/L [135 mg/dL]): 0 to 36, 40 to 64 and 144 to 168 h post-dose, thus covering the initial, middle and last part of the 1-week dosing interval. Glucose-lowering effect during a complete dosing interval was predicted by pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling.RESULTS: Model-predicted icodec steady state was attained after 3 to 4 weeks. At steady state, model-predicted daily proportions of glucose-lowering effect on days 1 to 7 of the 1-week dosing interval were 14.1%, 16.1%, 15.8%, 15.0%, 14.0%, 13.0% and 12.0%, respectively.

ONWARDS 4 aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of once-weekly icodec compared with once-daily insulin glargine U100 (glargine U100) in individuals with long-standing type 2 diabetes on a basal-bolus regimen.METHODS: In this 26-week, phase 3a, randomised, open-label, multicentre, treat-to-target, non-inferiority trial, adults from 80 sites (outpatient clinics and hospital departments) across nine countries (Belgium, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Romania, Russia, and the USA) with type 2 diabetes (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] 7·0-10·0%) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive once-weekly icodec or once-daily glargine U100 combined with 2-4 daily bolus insulin aspart injections. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 26 (non-inferiority margin of 0·3 percentage points). The primary outcome was evaluated in the full analysis set (ie, all randomly assigned participants). Safety outcomes were evaluated in the safety analysis set (ie, all participants randomly assigned who received at least one dose of trial product).

Although these combination regimens are recommended among the standard therapies, significant additional cost is a concern. The comparative cost-effectiveness of AFL and RAM was examined from the perspective of the Japanese health care payer.METHODS: A partitioned survival analysis was constructed. The data sources were the VELOUR (Aflibercept Versus Placebo in Combination With Irinotecan and 5-FU in the Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer After Failure of an Oxaliplatin Based Regimen) and RAISE (Ramucirumab Versus Placebo in Combination With Second-Line FOLFIRI in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma That Progressed During or After First-Line Therapy With Bevacizumab, Oxaliplatin, and a Fluoropyrimidine) trials, which compared FOLFIRI alone with AFL or RAM in second-line treatment for mCRC. The cost and effectiveness of the combination of AFL or RAM with FOLFIRI were compared with those of FOLFIRI alone and examined between both agents in a 10-year time horizon. The health outcomes were life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The costs were 2019 revisions to the drug prices and medical fees. The robustness of the model was verified by 1-way sensitivity analyses and a probability sensitivity analysis. A 2% annual discount was applied to the expenses and QALYs.

          "text": "The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer of aflibercept (Sanofi) to submit clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence for aflibercept in combination with irinotecan and fluorouracil-based therapy [irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (FOLFIRI)] for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer which has progressed following prior oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, as part of the Institute\u0027s Single Technology Appraisal process. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Centre for Health Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and the resulting NICE guidance TA307 issued in March 2014. The ERG critically reviewed the evidence presented in the manufacturer\u0027s submission and identified areas requiring clarification, for which the manufacturer provided additional evidence. The clinical effectiveness data were derived from one good-quality double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT), the VELOUR trial, which compared aflibercept plus FOLFIRI with placebo plus FOLFIRI. This RCT found a small but statistically significant increase in overall survival (OS); the difference in median OS was 1.44 months (13.5 months in the aflibercept group and 12.06 months in the placebo group). There was also a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival (PFS) with aflibercept; the difference in median PFS was 2.23 months (6.9 months in the aflibercept group and 4.67 months in the placebo group). However, grade 3-4 adverse events were more frequent in the aflibercept group than the placebo group: 83.5% compared with 62.5%. Treatment-emergent adverse events led to permanent discontinuation of treatment in 26.8% of patients in the aflibercept group and 12.1% of patients in the placebo group. The manufacturer\u0027s submission included an estimation of mean OS benefit based on extrapolation of the data, which was considerably longer than the median OS benefit reported (4.7 vs. 1.44 months). The ERG considered this to be an over estimate. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the overall population was reported by the manufacturer to be £36,294 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). After correcting the model programming and updating the model to include the ERG\u0027s preferred parameter estimates, the ICER from the ERG\u0027s alternative base case was £54,368 per QALY. The extrapolation of the OS curves was the key cost-effectiveness driver and a major source of uncertainty in the model. Additional scenarios related to the extrapolation of OS undertaken by the ERG resulted in ICERs between £62,894 and £92,089 per QALY. After consideration of the manufacturer\u0027s submission and the ERG\u0027s critique, and submissions from other stakeholders, the NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that aflibercept in combination with irinotecan and fluorouracil-based therapy could not be considered a cost effective use of National Health Service resources for treating metastatic colorectal cancer that is resistant to or has progressed after an oxaliplatin-containing regimen.",

The diagnosis was based on clinical examination, the existence of prolonged pain, the presence of bone marrow edema on magnetic resonance imaging, and the patient\u0027s medical history. The efficacy was assessed using changes in symptoms, visual analogue scale, and changes in magnetic resonance imaging. Results Overall, 54 patients (35.2% male) were included with bone marrow edema syndrome, with a mean age of 52.7 ± 9.77 years (range: 35 - 74 years). The most commonly affected joint was the knee in 32 patients (59.2%), followed by the foot/ankle in 13 patients (24.1%), and the hip in nine patients (16.7%). Improved mobility was reported by 29 patients (53.7%) among the total number of the patients at the six-month follow-up visit. The mean visual analogue scale was 6.77 ± 0.83, 7.25 ± 1.19, and 7.46 ± 0.96 at baseline and 5.11 ± 2.14, 4.25 ± 1.84 and 5.15 ± 2.03 at the six-month follow-up for the hip, knee and foot/ankle, respectively (p \u003d 0.098, p \u003c 0.001, p \u003d 0.002). At the six-month follow-up, the MRI showed resolution of the edema in 20 out of 54 patients (approximately 37%). Only 7.4% of the patients reported minor adverse events which were resolved through a single administration of paracetamol.",

For each study, information regarding study characteristics, description of the treatment, patient\u0027s demographic and clinical data, length of follow-up, clinical outcome measure, disability, adverse events, classification, and extent and of edema on MRI, were extracted.RESULTS: A total of 12 studies were identified. Two studies described treatment with iloprost, three with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), two with bisphosphonates, five with extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT). The total number of patients was 351: 34 treated with iloprost, 64 with hyperbaric oxygen, 37 with bisphosphonates, 216 with ESWT. In ESWT studies, treatment with a higher flux density and a higher number of therapy sessions lead to better clinical and radiological scores. In iloprost studies, a more remarkable improvement in the VAS scale was observed in the study on hip patients.CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of idiopathic bone marrow edema is currently not standardized, making it difficult to find data that can ",

Treatment options are mainly symptomatic with core decompression as surgical golden standard with immediate pain relief. Recently, it has been shown that intravenous iloprost can be used to achieve a reduction in BME and ON with a considerable improvement in the accompanying symptoms. The effect of intraveneously applied iloprost alone (12 patients) was studied against core decompression alone (12 patients) as well as iloprost following core decompression (12 patients). We could find a significant improvement in HHS, WOMAC score, SF-36 score and VAS 3 months and 1 year after therapeutical intervention in all treatment groups; however, statistically best results were obtained by combination. Concerning the MRI scans, we found a distinct reduction in BME in all groups again favoring the combination. Concerning ON, the results were not as promising as for BME.",

These are characterized by chemotherapy resistance and considered one of the key determinants driving tumor relapse. Many studies demonstrated that Glioma stem cells (GSCs) reside in particular tumor niches, that are necessary to support their behavior. A hypoxic microenvironment has been reported to play a crucial role in controlling GSC molecular and phenotypic profile and in promoting the recruitment of vascular and stromal cells in order to sustain tumor growth. Recent advances in the field allow researches to generate models able to recapitulate, at least in part, the extreme heterogeneity found within GBM tumors.

        "Glioblastoma (GBM) tumor microenvironment (TME) is a highly heterogeneous and complex system, which in addition to cancer cells, consists of various resident brain and immune cells as well as cells in transit through the tumor such as marrow-derived immune cells. The TME is a dynamic environment that is heavily influenced by alterations in cellular composition, cell-to-cell contact, and cellular metabolic products as well as other chemical factors, such as pH and oxygen levels. Emerging evidence suggests that GBM cells - especially glioma stem cells (GSCs) - appear to reprogram the TME, and hijack microenvironmental elements to facilitate rapid proliferation, invasion, migration, and survival thus generating treatment resistance and recurrence.",
        "According to the abstracts, the tumor microenvironment and factors like stem cells play a crucial role in contributing to the recurrence of glioblastoma. The microenvironment provides essential support for the aberrant growth of tumor stem cells, which are believed to contribute to therapeutic resistance and tumor recurrence. Growth factors derived from the tumor microenvironment can promote the proliferation of glioblastoma-derived stem-like cells (GDSCs). Additionally, the bidirectional crosstalk between glioma stem cells (GSCs) and their niche may also promote angiogenesis, invasion, proliferation, and stemness of GSCs, leading to recurrence. Furthermore, cancer stem cells can manipulate host immunity and create a self-advantageous microenvironment for themselves to regrow, ultimately contributing to cancer recurrence. Understanding the interactions between tumor stem cells and the microenvironment is essential to develop innovative therapies and diagnoses to achieve glioblastoma eradication.",
        "The tumor microenvironment (TME) of glioblastoma (GBM) is a complex and dynamic system that contributes to the aggressive growth, invasion, and recurrence of this deadly brain cancer. The TME is composed of various cell types, including cancer cells, resident brain cells, immune cells, and stem cells. Emerging evidence suggests that GBM cells can reprogram the TME to facilitate their own growth, survival, and migration, thereby promoting treatment resistance and recurrence. Glioma stem cells (GSCs), a subpopulation of cancer cells with stem-like properties, play a critical role in this process by continuously interacting with the TME and promoting disease progression.

Recent studies have reported that the development of IBD and CRC partly results from an imbalanced composition of intestinal microbiota and that intestinal inflammation in these diseases can be modulated by the microbiota. The human commensal Bacteroides fragilis is best exemplified playing a protective role against the development of experimental colitis in several animal disease models. In this study, we found that gut inflammation caused by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment was inhibited by B. fragilis colonization in mice. Further, we reveal a protective role of B. fragilis treatment against colon tumorigenesis using an azoxymethane (AOM)/DSS-induced model of colitis-associated colon cancer in mice and demonstrate that the decreased tumorigenesis by B. fragilis administration is accompanied by inhibited expression of C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) in the gut. We show direct evidence that the inhibition of tumor formation provided by B. fragilis in colitis-associated CRC animals was dependent on the production of polysaccharide A (PSA) from B. fragilis and that Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) signaling was responsible for the protective function of B. fragilisIMPORTANCE The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is rapidly growing worldwide, and there is therefore a greater emphasis on studies of the treatment or prevention of CRC pathogenesis.

Bacteroides fragilis can lead to tumorigenesis by changing signaling pathways, including the WNT/β-catenin pathway. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the correlation between the enterotoxigenic B. fragilis amount and the expression of signaling pathway genes involved in CRC.MATERIALS AND METHODS: B. fragilis was determined in 30 tumors and adjacent healthy tissues by the qPCR method. Next, the relationship between enterotoxigenic B. fragilis and the expression of signaling pathway genes, including CCND1, TP53, BCL2, BAX, WNT, TCF, AXIN, APC, and CTNNB1 was investigated. Additionally, possible correlations between clinicopathological features of the tumor samples and the abundance of B. fragilis were analyzed.RESULTS: The results showed that B. fragilis was detected in 100% of tumor samples and 86% of healthy tissues. Additionally, enterotoxigenic B. fragilis colonized 47% of all samples, and bft-1 toxin was the most frequently found isotype among the samples. The analysis showed that the high level of B. fragilis has a significant relationship with the high expression of AXIN, CTNNB1, and BCL2 genes.

          "text": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. CRC patients present with an increase in pathogens in their gut microbiota, such as polyketide synthase-positive bacteria (pks +) and enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF). The pks + Escherichia coli promotes carcinogenesis and facilitates CRC progression through the production of colibactin, a genotoxin that induces double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). ETBF is a procarcinogenic bacterium producing the B. fragilis toxin (bft) that promotes colorectal carcinogenesis by modulating the mucosal immune response and inducing epithelial cell changes.METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from healthy controls (N \u003d 62) and CRC patients (N \u003d 94) from the province of Québec (Canada), and a bacterial DNA extraction was performed. Fecal DNA samples were then examined for the presence of the pks island gene and bft using conventional qualitative PCR.RESULTS: We found that a high proportion of healthy controls are colonized by pks + bacteria (42%) and that these levels were similar in CRC patients (46%). bft was detected in 21% of healthy controls and 32% of CRC patients, while double colonization by both pks + bacteria and ETBF occurred in 8% of the healthy controls and 13% of the CRC patients. Most importantly, we found that early-onset CRC (\u003c 50 years) patients were significantly less colonized with pks + bacteria (20%) compared to la",

STAT3 activates by the interaction between epithelial cells and BFT. Thus, regulatory T-cell (Tregs) will activates and reduce interleukin (IL)-2 amount.

The goal of this review was to assess the status of the published evidence supporting (i) the association between ETBF and CRC and (ii) the causal role of ETBF in CRC. PubMed and Scopus searches were performed in August 2021 to identify human, animal, and cell studies pertaining to the role of ETBF in CRC. Inclusion criteria included the use of cell lines, mice, exposure to BFT or ETBF, and detection of bft. Review studies were excluded, and studies were limited to the English language. Quality of study design and risk of bias analysis was performed on the cell, animal, and human studies using ToxRTools, SYRCLE, and NOS, respectively.

On the contrary, enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF), a subtype of B. fragilis, produces an enterotoxin (BFT; B. fragilis toxin), leading to asymptomatic chronic infections and colonic tumor formation. However, the impact of B. fragilis and ETBF on the clinical outcome of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. We aim to assess whether their presence affects the outcome in patients with CRC after curative resection.METHODS: We obtained 197 pairs of matched formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from cancerous and adjacent non-cancerous tissues of patients with pathological stage (pstage) II and III CRC after curative resection. The presence of B. fragilis and ETBF were estimated using real-time polymerase chain reaction, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) of the patients were analyzed.RESULTS: 16 S rRNA for B. fragilis and bft DNA were detected in 120 (60.9%) and 12 (6.1%) of the 197 patients, respectively. B. fragilis-positive patients had better RFS than B. fragilis-negative patients, although that was not statistically significant. In subgroup analysis, better outcomes on RFS were observed in the presence of B. fragilis in pstage II and left-sided CRC. The association of B. fragilis positivity on OS was accentuated in the depth of T4 subgroup. No significant differences were observed in RFS and OS between ETBF and non-toxigenic B. fragilis.CONCLUSIONS: Ou",

In this study, we produced recombinant Bacteroides fragilis enterotoxin-1 (rBFT1) and demonstrate that rBFT1 could promote cell proliferation in colorectal cancer cells and accelerate tumor growth in vivo. To identify the mechanisms, we further investigated CCL3/CCR5 and NF-κB pathway. We found that CCL3, CCR5, NF-κB, and TRAF-6 were dramatically upregulated after rBFT1 treatment, thus suggesting that the role of rBFT1 in CRC progression may be associated with CCL3/CCR5 and NF-κB pathways.",

To fill this gap, we leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on wildtype mice and mouse model of CRC. We find that Fn and ETBF exacerbate cancer-like transcriptional phenotypes in transit-amplifying and mature enterocytes in a mouse model of CRC. We also observed increased T cells in the pathobiont-exposed mice, but these pathobiont-specific differences observed in wildtype mice were abrogated in the mouse model of CRC.

Intestinal inflammation is mediated by BFT, as yet the only known virulence factor of ETBF. Recent experimental evidence demonstrating that ETBF-driven colitis promotes colon tumorigenesis has generated interest in the potential contribution of ETBF to human colon carcinogenesis",
        "The molecular mechanism by which Bacteroides Fragilis (ETBF) is associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) development involves the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)3. ETBF interacts with epithelial cells, leading to STAT3 activation, which in turn activates regulatory T-cells (Tregs). This reduces interleukin (IL)-2 levels, promoting the generation of T-helper (Th17) cells and increasing IL-17 production. IL-17 induces early intestinal inflammation, cancer cell survival, and proliferation, ultimately activating the STAT3 pathway. Additionally, ETBF degrades E-cadherin, altering signaling pathways and upregulating spermine oxidase, leading to carcinogenesis and irreversible DNA damage. Long noncoding RNA BFAL1 also plays a role in mediating ETBF-induced CRC by activating the RHEB/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, ETBF induces stemness in CRC cells by upregulating histone demethylase JMJD2B, which epigenetically regulates core",

However, a subtype of B. fragilis, known as enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF), produces an enterotoxin called B. fragilis toxin (BFT) that can lead to asymptomatic chronic infections and colonic tumor formation. ETBF has been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) through a molecular mechanism involving the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)3, which is triggered by the interaction between epithelial cells and BFT. This activation of STAT3 leads to an increase in the levels of interleukin (IL)-17 due to the generation of T-helper (Th17) cells and a reduction in the amount of IL-2 due to the activation of regulatory T-cell (Tregs). The enterotoxin BFT has also been shown to trigger the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, which releases prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and contributes to inflammation and the control of cell proliferation, leading to the development of CRC.",

BFT cleaves the adherens junction protein E-cadherin, disrupting the intestinal epithelial barrier and triggering inflammation. \n\n2. BFT binding to epithelial receptors activates cell signaling pathways that cause increased cell proliferation, likely in a c-Myc-dependent manner.

BFT may alter signaling in pathways like WNT/β-catenin that are often dysregulated in colorectal cancer.\n\nIn summary, BFT from ETBF strains damages the colonic epithelium, induces inflammation, and directly promotes proliferation and oncogenic signaling. This creates a tumor-promoting microenvironment that, over time, can lead to colorectal cancer development, likely in conjunction with other genetic and environmental risk factors.

Specifically, the high level of enterotoxigenic B. fragilis has a significant relationship with the high expression of AXIN, CTNNB1, and BCL2 genes, which are involved in CRC. The WNT/β-catenin pathway, in particular, is altered by B. fragilis, leading to tumorigenesis. Additionally, the toxin produced by enterotoxigenic B. fragilis, bft-1, may also play a role in inducing inflammatory diarrhea and promoting colon tumorigenesis. Overall, the molecular mechanism involves the dysregulation of cellular signaling pathways and genes, potentially contributing to CRC development. Further research is needed to fully understand the molecular mechanisms by which B. fragilis regulates cellular signaling pathways and its impact on CRC.",

However, the connectivity, nuclear structure, and function of the globus pallidus externus are still not well-understood. Increasing evidence for the existence of direct corticopallidal connections challenges traditional understanding of the connectivity of the globus pallidus externus; nevertheless, these corticopallidal connections have yet to be fully characterized in humans. The objective of this study was to assess the corticopallidal connections of the globus pallidus externus by means of probabilistic diffusion-weighted MR imaging tractography using high-resolution, multishell data.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Imaging data from the open-access Human Connectome Project data base were used to perform probabilistic tractography between the globus pallidus externus and the cerebral cortex using 34 distinct cortical regions. Group averages were calculated for normalized percentages of tracts reaching each of the cortical targets, and side-to-side comparison was made.RESULTS: Cortical connectivity was demonstrated between the globus pallidus externus and multiple cortical regions, including direct connection to putative sensorimotor, associative, and limbic areas. Connectivity patterns were not significantly different between the right and left hemispheres with the exception of the frontal pole, which showed a greater number of connections on the right (P \u003d .004).CONCLUSIONS: Our in vivo study of the human globus pallidus externus using probabilistic tractography supports the existence of extensive corticopallidal connections",

We assessed streamline count of the reconstructed bundles and investigated spatial relations between pallidal voxels connected to the PPN and pallidal limbic, associative and sensorimotor functional territories. Results: We successfully reconstructed pallidotegmental tracts for the GPi and GPe in all subjects. The number of streamlines connecting the PPN with the GPi was greater than the number of those joining it with the GPe.",

Acetylcholinesterase staining of both fibers and cell bodies, frequently used as a marker for the basal nucleus of Meynert, is also found in the area of the substantia innominata. This study describes the differential distribution of enkephalin-positive woolly fibers and acetylcholinesterase staining on adjacent sections in both the monkey and human basal forebrain area in an attempt to define the relationship between the basal ganglia and the basal nucleus of Meynert. The results show that while both occupy large regions of the basal forebrain, they overlap very little.

At the electron microscopic level, the pallidal boutons were classified as two types.

This structure implies integration of the information as it is transferred through the basal ganglia. In order to investigate this integration, we studied the collateralization of striatal efferents to the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra-ventral tegmental area. Retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers were injected into the target areas of striatal efferents. Nuclear yellow or propidium iodide was injected into the substantia nigra-ventral tegmental area (SN-VTA) and 4-acetamido, 4\u0027-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2\u0027-disulfonic acid (SITS) into the globus pallidus (GP) of adult albino rats. SITS was chosen for the pallidal injections because it is not taken up by fibers-of-passage. The pressure injections resulted in large injection sites which covered the majority of each efferent target area, and as a result retrogradely labeled cell bodies were found throughout the entire extent of the striatum. Cell bodies double-labeled with both dyes were found intermingled with single-labeled cell bodies. In rats injected with propidium iodide in the SN-VTA and SITS in the GP, 70% of all neurons (as revealed by Nissl staining) were labeled. Of these labeled cells, 40% were double labeled, 20% contained only SITS and 40% contained only propidium iodide. Thus a substantial number of the striatal neurons that project to the SN-VTA also possess collateral axons to the GP. Some striatal neurons appear to project to only the SN-VTA or only to the GP.",

More than 80% of low-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastoma (GBM) harbor an IDH mutation. IDH mutations involve the catalytic pocket of the enzyme and lead to a neomorphic ability to produce 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) while oxidizing NADPH to NADP+. 2HG is considered as an \u0027oncometabolite\u0027 which is thought to be responsible for many, if not all, biologic effects of IDH mutations. 2HG accumulation competitively inhibits α-KG-dependent dioxygenases, including histone lysine demethylases and DNA demethylases, resulting in a hypermethylation phenotype with alterations in cellular epigenetic status as well as a block in cellular differentiation. IDH mutations have been suggested as an important early event in tumorigenesis, however it remains unclear whether IDH mutation by itself causes cancer or if it requires other oncogenic events to initiate tumorigenesis. Significant efforts have been made to better understand the mechanisms of IDH mutations in tumor initiation and progression, and to develop targeted therapies for IDH-mutated tumors.",

        "Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is a key rate-limiting enzyme in the Krebs cycle that plays an important role in energy metabolism. In recent years, it has been found that IDH mutations are closely related to the occurrence and development of glioma, and it is a notable potential therapeutic target. First, IDH mutations can produce high levels of 2-hydroxyglutaric acid (2-HG), thereby inhibiting glioma stem cell differentiation. At the same time, IDH mutations can upregulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to promote the formation of the tumor microenvironment. In addition, IDH mutations can also induce high levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) to promote glioma invasion. Ultimately, these changes will lead to the development of glioma. Finally, in addition to affecting gliomas directly, mutations in IDH can also alter their immune microenvironment and can change immune-cell function in direct and indirect ways. Currently, a large number of IDH inhibitors and vaccines have entered clinical trials, representing progress in the treatment of glioma patients.",

IDH mutations are a favorable prognostic factor for human glioma and can be used as a biomarker for differential diagnosis and subclassification.

We examined the association between fish consumption, dietary and circulating levels of n-3 LC-PUFAs, and ratio of n-6:n-3 LC-PUFA with CRC using data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort.METHODS: Dietary intake of fish (total, fatty/oily, lean/white) and n-3 LC-PUFA were estimated by food frequency questionnaires given to 521,324 participants in the EPIC study; among these, 6291 individuals developed CRC (median follow up, 14.9 years). Levels of phospholipid LC-PUFA were measured by gas chromatography in plasma samples from a sub-group of 461 CRC cases and 461 matched individuals without CRC (controls). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards and conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs), respectively, with 95% CIs.RESULTS: Total intake of fish (HR for quintile 5 vs 1, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80-0.96; Ptrend \u003d .005), fatty fish (HR for quintile 5 vs 1, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.98; Ptrend \u003d .009), and lean fish (HR for quintile 5 vs 1, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83-1.00; Ptrend \u003d .016) were inversely associated with CRC incidence.

Many factors, including genetic, immune, and environmental factors, influence the occurrence and development of CRC. Along with the economic development, changes in lifestyle, especially dietary factors, have been shown to greatly affect the progression of CRC. Increasing evidence showed that dietary patterns influence the risk of CRC and affect CRC treatment. The present review describes the role of diet in the prevention and treatment of CRC with the hope that doctors attach importance to dietary patterns in educating patients with CRC or at risk of CRC and that diet may be regarded as an auxiliary treatment strategy to improve patients\u0027 outcomes.Methods: English language articles published from 2000 to December 2021 in PubMed and Embase were identified by searching titles for keywords including \"diet\", \"colorectal cancer\", \"dietary pattern\", and \"dietary factor\"; 101 articles were selected for review.Key Content and Findings: The present review describes the role of different dietary patterns and factors in the prevention and treatment of CRC.

        "Fish intake has been inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk in several studies. A case-control study in Sweden found that canned fish consumption was lower among cases than among controls, and an inverse association was found between canned fish consumption and CRC risk. A cohort study in Sweden found that higher intake of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are abundant in fish, was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer in women. A meta-analysis of 41 studies found that fish consumption was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer. However, a cohort study in the United States found no association between fish intake and colorectal cancer risk. Overall, the evidence suggests that fish intake may be a protective factor against colorectal cancer, but more research is needed to confirm this association.",
        "Yes, fish intake has been shown to be a protective factor against colorectal cancer. Studies have consistently found that higher consumption of fish, particularly fatty fish, is associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer. The mechanisms by which fish consumption protects against colorectal cancer are thought to involve the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in the colon. Additionally, adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet, which includes high levels of fish consumption, has been shown to be protective against colorectal and breast cancer.",

        "Yes, fish intake is inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk, with a 12% decrease in risk found in a meta-analysis. This association is supported by multiple observational and clinical studies, which suggest that fish consumption may have a protective effect against colorectal cancer. The protective effect is thought to be due to the high content of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, in some fish.",
        "Yes, fish intake is a protective factor against colorectal cancer. Multiple studies have found that increased fish consumption is inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk. A meta-analysis found that fish consumption decreased the risk of colorectal cancer by 12%. Other studies have also found that high fish intake is associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer, which has been linked to the high content of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in some fish.",
        "Fish intake is linked to reduced colorectal cancer (CRC) risk according to multiple studies. Moderate fish consumption and n-3 fatty acids from fish show inverse associations with CRC incidence, suggesting fish consumption provides protection against the disease.",
        "Yes, fish intake is a protective factor against colorectal cancer. A number of studies have found an inverse relationship between fish consumption and the risk of developing colorectal cancer. For example, a case-control study in Eastern Europe found that increased fish intake was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer, even after adjusting for potential confounders such as demographic characteristics, body mass index, smoking status, and physical activity. Similarly, a prospective cohort study in the United States found that men who consumed fish at least once a week had a lower risk of colorectal cancer than those who rarely or never consumed fish. The protective effect of fish consumption on colorectal cancer risk may be due to the presence of long-chain n-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects in laboratory and animal studies. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the underlying mechanisms",
        "Yes, fish intake is a protective factor against colorectal cancer. This is based on a long-term prospective study that found intakes of fish and long-chain n-3 fatty acids from fish may decrease the risk for colorectal cancer. Additionally, a case-control study found that higher freshwater fish and sea fish intake is inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk among Chinese population.",

        "Yes, fish intake appears to be a protective factor against colorectal cancer. Several epidemiological studies and meta-analyses have found an inverse association between fish consumption and colorectal cancer risk. The protective effect may be attributed to the high content of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in some fish. These PUFAs are thought to suppress the proliferation of colorectal mucosa and inhibit the development of colorectal cancer. Overall, the evidence suggests that increasing fish intake may have a preventive effect on colorectal cancer risk.",
        "Based on the abstracts provided, it appears that fish intake is indeed a protective factor against colorectal cancer. The first study found an inverse association between fish intake and colorectal cancer risk, with a multivariate relative risk of 0.63 for the highest versus lowest category of fish intake. Similarly, the second study found a significant reduction in colorectal cancer risk at moderate fish intake (one or two servings per week), with an odds ratio of 0.70. The third study also suggested a protective effect of fish consumption against colorectal cancer, although the association was not statistically significant. Overall, the evidence suggests that consuming fish may decrease the risk of developing colorectal cancer.",

The study found that individuals who consumed more fish had a significantly reduced risk of CRC. Specifically, those in the highest category of fish consumption had a 6% lower risk of CRC compared to those in the lowest category. Additionally, for every 50g increase in daily fish consumption, there was a 4% reduction in CRC risk. The study suggests that dietary recommendations for cancer prevention should take into account the evidence from epidemiological and preclinical studies that increasing fish consumption may be effective in preventing CRC.",
        "Yes, fish intake appears to be a protective factor against colorectal cancer (CRC). According to a study, individuals who consumed fish at higher levels had a significantly reduced risk of CRC compared to those who consumed less fish. In a dose-response meta-analysis, a 50-g increase in daily fish consumption was associated with a statistically significant 4% reduction in CRC risk. Therefore, increasing fish intake may help lower the risk of developing colorectal cancer.",

        "The evidence is not conclusive to establish a causal relationship between fish intake and a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. While some studies suggest a protective effect, others show no association or even a positive correlation. The potential benefits of fish consumption should be weighed against the risks associated with contaminants such as mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). More research is needed to better understand the relationship between fish consumption and colorectal cancer risk, and to determine the optimal amount and type of fish intake for cancer prevention.",

The role of the exposome is to understand how the totality of an individual\u0027s exposures throughout the lifetime can impact human health. The etiology of a health condition is rarely explained by a single exposure. Therefore, examining the human exposome as a whole becomes relevant to simultaneously consider multiple risk factors and more accurately estimate concurrent causes of different health outcomes. Generally, the exposome is explained through three domains: general external exposome, specific external exposome, and internal exposome. The general external exposome includes measurable population-level exposures such as air pollution or meteorological factors.

The exposome comprises the totality of chemical, biological, and physical exposures that individuals encounter over their lifetimes. Traditional environmental and biological monitoring only targets specific substances, whereas exposomic approaches identify and quantify thousands of substances simultaneously using nontargeted high-throughput and high-resolution analyses. The quantified self (QS) aims at enhancing our understanding of human health and disease through self-tracking. QS measurements are critical in exposome research, as external exposures impact an individual\u0027s health, behavior, and biology.",

Considering the complexity of exposures and, in addition, the reactions of the body to exposures - i.e., the exposome - reverses classical exposure science where the precise measurement of single or few exposures is associated with specific health or environmental effects. The complete description of an individual\u0027s exposome is impossible; even less so is that of a population. We can, however, cast a wider net by foregoing some rigor in assessment and compensating with the statistical power of rich datasets. The advent of omics technologies enables a relatively cheap, high-content description of the biological effects of substances, especially in tissues and biofluids. They can be combined with many other rich data-streams, creating big data of exposure and effect. Computational methods increasingly allow data integration, discerning the signal from the noise and formulating hypotheses of exposure-effect relationships. These can be followed up in a targeted way. With a better exposure element in the risk equation, exposomics - new kid on the block of risk assessment - promises to identify novel exposure (interactions) and health/environment effect associations. This may also create opportunities to prioritize the more relevant chemicals for risk assessment, thereby lowering the burden on hazard assessment in an expo-sure-driven approach.",

Increasing data availability will help improve ES-SCZ that can be used in staging models to enhance clinical characterization and outcome forecasting. Although an ES-SCZ already provides several practical benefits for research practice, the exposome paradigm offers much more. Agnostic exposure-wide analyses might be the first step to mapping the exposome of mental disorders.

It encompasses also \"psychosocial components\" including the impact of social relations and socio-economic position on health. In this review we provide examples of recent contributions from exposome research, where we believe their application will be of the greatest value for moving forward. So far, environmental epidemiology has mainly focused on hard outcomes, such as mortality, disease exacerbation and hospitalizations. However, there are many subtle outcomes that can be related to environmental exposures, and investigations can be facilitated by an improved understanding of internal biomarkers of exposure and response, through the application of omic technologies. Second, though we have a wealth of studies on environmental pollutants, the assessment of causality is often difficult because of confounding, reverse causation and other uncertainties. Biomarkers and omic technologies may allow better causal attribution, for example using instrumental variables in triangulation, as we discuss here. Even more complex is the understanding of how social relationships (in particular socio-economic differences) influence health and imprint on the fundamental biology of the individual. The identification of molecular changes that are intermediate between social determinants and disease status is a way to fill the gap. Another field in which biomarkers and omics are relevant is the study of mixtures. Epidemiology often deals with complex mixtures (e.g. ambient air pollution, food, smoking) without fully disentangling the compositional complexity of the mixture, or with rudimentary approaches to reflect the overall effect of multiple exposures or components. From the point of view of disease mechanisms, most models hypothesize that several stages need to be transitioned through health to the induction of disease, but very little is known about the characteristics and temporal sequence of such stages. Exposome models reinforce the idea of a biography-to-biology transition, in that everyone\u0027s disease is the product of the individual history of exposures, superimposed on their underlying genetic susceptibilities.",

However, initial applications of the exposome concept have been less apt at measuring social determinants of health, focusing primarily on conventional environmental exposures and lifestyle choices that do not reflect the complex lived experience of many communities. To bring community voice into the exposome concept, the HERCULES Exposome Research Center and its Stakeholder Advisory Board co-developed the Exposome Roadshow. We present and discuss the resulting community-exposome definition to inform and improve exposome research.Materials and Methods: Four communities from distinct areas across metro-Atlanta participated in separate 2-day Exposome Roadshow workshops with concept mapping. Aligned with a popular education approach in which community knowledge is used to work collectively for change, concept mapping provided a systematic method to collect and visualize community members\u0027 knowledge and create a shared understanding to take action. Community members brainstormed, sorted, and rated their responses to the prompt: \"What in your environment is affecting your and your community\u0027s health?\" Responses were analyzed and visually depicted by concept maps consisting of separate but interrelated clusters of ideas. Community members discussed and validated the maps, selecting a final map illustrating their community\u0027s exposome.Results: A total of 118 community members completed concept mapping.

Although the possible relationship among the exposome factors, epigenetic modifications, and health/disease has been investigated extensively, all previous studies start from the assumption that epigenetic changes are always detrimental to (or represent an adverse effect on) the health of the affected individual. We hereby propose a new approach to investigate these modifications, and their possible relation with human health, in the context of the exposome. Our hypothesis is based on the possibility that some environmentally-induced changes are plastic entities, responding physiologically to the environment to allow individual adaptation. Briefly, after evaluating the association between environmental exposure and the variation of a given biological parameter through regression models, we use the estimated regression function to predict values for each study subject. We then calculated the relative percent difference (PD) between the measured (i.e., observed) biological parameter and the predicted (i.e., expected) from the model.",

Measuring cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels can provide additional diagnostic information."

We calculated age-adjusted and age-specific incidence as well as actuarial survival rates, and examined histological type, site, stage at diagnosis, and treatment. We compared these data to colorectal cancer data from whites living in western Washington.RESULTS: In all, 587 colorectal cancer cases were identified among Alaska Natives over the 25-year period, for an age-adjusted annual incidence rate of 71.4/100000 in women, and 69.3/100000 in men. Compared to Alaska Indians, colon cancer rates were significantly higher in Aleuts (relative risk [RR] \u003d 1.6, 95% CI: 1.2-2.2) and in Eskimos (RR \u003d 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-1.8), while rectal cancer rates did not differ by race/ethnicity. Alaska Natives experienced a 50% higher incidence rate of colorectal cancer overall compared to western Washington whites (RR \u003d 1.5, 95% CI: 1.3-1.6), although rectal cancer rates were similar in the two populations. The highest RR were seen among Alaska Native women; Aleuts and Eskimos had colon cancer rates more than twice that of western Washington white women. No unusual qualitative features were found in the cancers occurring in Alaska Natives. Actuarial colorectal cancer survival rates for Alaska Natives overall were 74% at one year and 42% at 5 years; these rates were very similar to those observed for the western Washington population.

Racial differences in colorectal cancer screening behavior may contribute to the racial disparity in incidence and mortality. The purpose of this study was to determine if colorectal cancer screening rates are different between blacks and whites while controlling for potential confounders.STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. DATA SOURCE(S)/STUDY SETTING: We used data from the North Carolina Colon Cancer Study, a population-based case-control study conducted in 33 counties of North Carolina. We analyzed data from 598 control subjects who were eligible for colorectal cancer screening.METHODS: Trained nurses conducted face-to-face interviews from October 1996 through October 2000.RESULTS: Overall, 50% of the respondents were compliant with CRC screening guidelines. In the multivariable logistic regression model having a regular doctor and participation in a general medical exam were significantly associated with current screening status with odds ratios (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) of 3.8 (1.7-8.3) and 3.7 (2.1-6.7), respectively. Older age was a significant predictor of current screening status with an OR (95% CI) of 2.9 (1.7-4.8) for those 60-69 compared to respondents 50-59 and OR 3.2 (1.9-5.5) for those 70 and older compared to respondents 50-59. After adjusting for age, having a regular doctor and participation in general medical exams, race was not significantly associated with current CRC screening status, with an OR of 1.1 (95% CI 0.7-1.6).CONCLUSION: CRC screening rates in North Carolina were low. Race was not a significant determinant of screening behavior and therefore does not explain the racial disparity in incidence or survival.

        "Black Americans demonstrating the highest incidence and mortality from this disease",
        "The race with the highest incidence of colorectal cancer is African Americans, particularly African American females. This was found in a study that analyzed data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Registry (SEER) of individuals aged 45-79 years from 2000-2017. The results showed that while the incidence of colorectal cancer decreased for both males and females during the study period, African Americans had the least decline in incidence. Moreover, African American females had the highest risk for colorectal cancer compared to other females or males from different racial groups, and they also had the poorest 5-year survival rate among females. This highlights the need for targeted interventions and screening strategies to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer in this population.",
        "Black Americans have the highest incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to other racial/ethnic groups in the United States. This is supported by multiple studies and sources, including a 2016 report stating that CRC incidence was higher among Blacks (42.5 per 100,000) than Whites (38.0), Latinos (31.7) and Asians (30.0). Additionally, a 2012 study found that after a mean follow-up of 10.8 years, CRC incidence was the highest in African-Americans (annualized rate \u003d 0.14%) compared to Whites, Native Americans, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics. A 2021 study also found that Black Americans have a higher risk of CRC incidence and mortality compared to other groups.",
        "Black Americans have the highest incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to other racial and ethnic groups in the United States. This is consistent across various studies and sources, which show that CRC incidence and mortality rates are significantly higher in Black Americans compared to non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans. The disparity in CRC incidence and mortality rates between Black Americans and other racial and ethnic groups is likely due to a combination of genetic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors. It is important to continue researching and addressing these disparities to improve CRC outcomes for all populations.",
        "African Americans have the highest incidence of colorectal cancer in the United States, with a younger mean age at diagnosis and greater proportion of proximal cancers compared to whites. Survival rates are also lower for African Americans with this type of cancer. Socioeconomic, lifestyle, and healthcare factors do not fully explain the racial disparity, suggesting other etiologic factors may be important in Black American populations.",
        "The race with the highest incidence of colorectal cancer is African Americans (AAs). This racial group has been consistently shown to have higher rates of colorectal cancer incidence and mortality compared to other races in the United States. The disparity between AAs and Non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs) is multifactorial, including genetic, environmental, and societal factors. Some studies suggest that interventions such as increasing screening utilization rates among AAs to match NHWs can help reduce this incidence disparity. Additionally, research has identified unique genetic and epigenetic changes in AA colorectal cancers, which could lead to more precise approaches to colorectal cancer care for this population. Despite these findings, there is still a need for a better understanding of the etiologic factors contributing to the higher incidence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer among African Americans.",
        "The race with the highest incidence of colorectal cancer is non-Hispanic Black service members, but this study observed similar rates of colorectal cancer for all races and ethnicities after adjusting for age.",
        "Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in the United States and is the second leading cause of cancer death. According to the most recent data, African Americans had the highest incidence rate among all races.",
        "Summary: African Americans have the highest incidence of colorectal cancer in the United States with a younger mean age at diagnosis and lower survival rates compared to whites. Socioeconomic, lifestyle, and healthcare factors do not fully explain this disparity.",
        "The race with the highest incidence of colorectal cancer is African Americans, who have the highest colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates of any U.S. racial/ethnic group. This disparity exists despite efforts to promote awareness and screening, and is not fully explained by established risk factors or socioeconomic status. In fact, researchers are actively seeking to understand other etiologic factors that may contribute to this health disparity. Additionally, African Americans with colorectal cancer tend to be diagnosed at a younger age and have more proximal cancers compared to whites, further highlighting the need for targeted interventions to reduce this health disparity.",
        "According to the provided information, African Americans have the highest incidence rates of colorectal cancer compared to other racial and ethnic groups in the United States. The data consistently shows that colorectal cancer incidence is significantly higher in African Americans than in non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and other racial groups. African Americans are about 20% more likely to get colorectal cancer and 40% more likely to die from it than most other groups.",
        "The race with the highest incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the United States is Black Americans. This was observed across all age groups, with no decrease in incidence seen in any age group in 2016. The disparity in CRC incidence and mortality between racial and ethnic groups appears to be multifactorial, with structured societal issues, abnormal environmental factors, and cancer-specific immune and genetic changes contributing to the observed differences. Although acquiring additional knowledge into the science behind these disparities is crucial for developing interventions that reduce both CRC incidence and mortality, current evidence suggests that prevention through CRC screening has been effective in mitigating the disparity, but only before CRC has developed.",
        "The race with the highest incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is Black Americans. This has been consistently observed across different age groups. The incidence of CRC among Black Americans is persistently higher compared to other racial groups, making them the most affected demographic in terms of CRC occurrence.",
        " Africans, certain genetic, lifestyle, and clinical factors may contribute to a higher incidence of colorectal cancer in specific populations, but the overall risk is influenced by a complex interplay of various factors and may vary among individuals within each population. Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of appropriate cancer treatments are essential for reducing morbidity and improving outcomes. ",
        "Black Americans have the highest incidence and mortality rate from colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to other racial groups. This was observed across all age groups.",
        "Summary: Black Americans have the highest incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the United States across all age groups. The disparity is multifactorial and includes societal issues, environmental factors, and immune or genetic changes. While prevention through screening mitigates disparities before CRC develops, further research is needed to understand these differences fully.",

The membrane proximal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor repeats in LRP6 exhibit homology to ligand binding repeats in the LDL receptor (LDLR), but lack known function. We generated single amino acid substitutions of LRP6-LDLR repeat residues, which are highly conserved in the human LDLR and mutated in patients with Familial Hypercholesteremia (FH). These substitutions negatively impacted LRP6 internalization and activation of Wnt signaling.

LGR6 was found as one of the novel genes mutated in colon cancer through total exon sequencing and its promoter region is hypermethylated in 20-50% of colon cancer cases. In the skin, LGR6 marks a population of stem cells that can give rise to all cell lineages. Recently, we and others demonstrated that LGR4 and LGR5 function as receptors of R-spondins to potentiate Wnt/β-catenin signaling. However, the binding affinity and functional response of LGR6 to R-spondins, and the activity of colon cancer mutants of LGR6 have not been determined.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found that LGR6 also binds and responds to R-spondins 1-3 with high affinity to enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling through increased LRP6 phosphorylation. Similar to LGR4 and LGR5, LGR6 is not coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins or to β-arrestin following R-spondin stimulation. Functional and expression analysis of three somatic mutations identified in colon cancer samples indicates that one mutant fails to bind and respond to R-spondin (loss-of-function), but the other two have no significant effect on receptor function. Overexpression of wild-type LGR6 in HeLa cells leads to increased cell migration following co-treatment with R-spondin1 and Wnt3a when compared to vector control cells or cells overexpressi",

We have investigated this issue through a structure-function analysis of Frizzled and LRP proteins that have been implicated in Wnt1 signaling. Consistent with other reports, we find that LRP6/Arrow proteins deleted for their extracellular domain are able to activate the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Importantly, our results demonstrate that this signaling from LRP6/Arrow derivatives can occur in a Frizzled- and ligand-independent manner. Furthermore, we show that the PPSP motifs within the intracellular domain of LRP6 are required for signaling.

We report herein our experience of a patient who showed complete response to chemotherapy and marked PS improvement. The patient presented with the following adverse factors poor PS, advanced progression of metastatic lesions, advanced unresectable colorectal cancer with severe stricture, and old age.PRESENTATION OF CASE: The patient was an 80-year-old male diagnosed with occlusive cancer of the descending colon with multiple metastases in the liver, Stage Ⅳb (National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines version 2. 2018). A 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) + panitumumab (Pmab) regimen was successfully administered and led to decreased tumor marker levels; oral intake also became possible. Additional examinations showed that the primary lesion and distant metastatic lesions had almost disappeared; the patient had achieved a near complete response (CR). Currently, 35 cycles of mFOLFOX6＋Pmab have been administered, and his near CR has been maintained for 32 months.DISCUSSION: Best supportive care (BSC) is the recommended option for elderly patients with advanced unresectable colon cancer.

The current study aims to delineate potential differences in outcomes between metastatic colorectal cancer patients with ECOG score 0 versus 1 who are treated with currently accepted first-line fluorouracil (5FU)-based chemotherapy.METHODS: The current study is based on a pooled dataset from five clinical trials of 5FU-based treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (NCT00272051; NCT00115765; NCT00305188; NCT00364013; and NCT00384176). Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and ECOG score of 0-1 were eligible for the current study. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between ECOG performance status and the development of different toxicities. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were used to clarify the impact of the ECOG score on overall and progression-free survivals. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was then used to evaluate the impact of ECOG score on overall and progression-free survivals.RESULTS: A total of 3143 patients were included in the current analysis. Within multivariable logistic regression analysis, patients with an ECOG score of 0 have a lower probability of serious adverse events (OR 0.678; 95% CI 0.583-0.788; P \u003c 0.001), fatal adverse events (OR 0.552; 95% CI 0.397-0.766; P \u003c 0.001), high-grade anemia (OR 0.426; 95% CI 0.252-0.721; P \u003d 0.001), and high-grade nausea/vomiting (OR 0.697; 95% CI 0.509-0.955; P \u003d 0.024).

However, despite its characteristic of being subjective and unidimensional, it has become one of the most important prognostic variables for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In light of the considerable progressive prolongation of median overall survival (OS) of patients with mCRC, it is unclear whether PS continues to be a valid prognostic factor. This article aims to perform a meta-analysis to verify the current prognostic role of PS.METHODS: A search on two databases of prospective trials of first-line chemotherapy in mCRC patients, published in English from 1991 to 2020, was done by predefined criteria. After the selection of phase III trials evaluating the prognostic role of PS, a meta-analysis has been performed.RESULTS: Thirteen trials were included in the meta-analysis. They reported a reduction in the risk of death with a PS 0 compared to a PS 1 or more (HR 0.63, CI 0.54-0.72; 13 studies), which was confirmed for the comparison between PS 0 and PS 1. However, the study found significant heterogeneity (Q \u003d 68.10; p-value \u003c 0.001) and high-grade inconsistency (I2 \u003d 82.38%).

A multivariable Cox regression model was used to adjust for prognostic factors and logistic regression, to identify predictive factors of Grade 3/4 toxicity.RESULTS: From June 2008 to June 2012, 240 consecutive patients were included: 100 (41.7%) had an ECOG PS of 0/1, 75 (31.3%) ECOG PS of 2, and 65 (27%) ECOG PS of 3/4.

It is based on drug-eluting microspheres pre-loaded with chemotherapeutics, which are injected selectively into vessels supplying the tumour, to embolize them inducing ischaemia, and elute the drug, to induce tumour response. We present our initial experience with novel irinotecan- loaded Embocure Plus microspheres in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer tumours in the liver, and their effect on HCT-116 cell cultures in vitro.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three consecutive male patients (median age 62 [50-76] years) with liver metastatic colorectal cancer tumours were selected. All patients had a pre-procedure contrast-enhanced computed tomography, confirming multiple metastatic liver tumours (mean tumour diameter \u003d 42 mm; range: 14-77 mm) and periprocedural dyna-CT scans for rapid treatment results assessment. In vitro: Human colon HCT116 cancer cell line was cultured, irinotecan loaded Embocure Plus microspheres were added. Cultures were assessed after 24 hours and 72 hours of incubation in normoxia or hypoxia.RESULTS: All embolizations were technically successful, and no complications were observed. Stabilization of the targeted metastatic liver tumours in all patients was noted. In vitro: Significant decrease of the growth of HTC 116 cell lines were observed in controls compared to cells treated with Embocure Plus loaded with irinotecan in normoxia and hypoxia after 48 and 72 hours. We observed a tendency for less inhibited cell p",

In addition, the role of TACE in the treatment of CRCLM is also worth discussing.METHODS: This single-center retrospective study evaluated the consecutive medical records of patients with CRCLM treated with TACE from June 2014 to June 2018, who had failed at least two lines of prior chemotherapy. Therapeutic response, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and complications were recorded.RESULTS: Fifty-three eligible patients were included in our study. The objective tumor radiologic regression and disease control rates were 52.8% and 79.2%, respectively. Median OS and PFS were 15 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 13.1 months, 16.9 months) and 6 months (95% CI 4.7 months, 7.3 months), respectively. Multivariate analysis found that synchronous metastatic disease, presence of extrahepatic metastasis, and Child-Pugh score B were independent prognostic factor for OS and PFS. Two patients (3.8%) had severe complications. The results of subgroup analysis showed that synchronous liver metastasis and extrahepatic metastasis had an effect on the prognosis of patients, while the primary tumor sites (rectum, left, and right colon) had no",

          "text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common tumor entities worldwide and a common cause of cancer-associated death. Colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM) thereby constitute a severe life-limiting factor. The therapy of CRLM presents a major challenge and surgical resection as well as systemic chemotherapy remain the first-line treatment options. Over the years several locoregional, vascular- and image-based treatments offered by interventional radiologists have emerged when conventional therapies fail, or metastases recurrence occurs. Among such options is the conventional/traditional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) by local injection of a combination of chemotherapeutic- and embolic-agents. A similar treatment is the more recent irinotecan-loaded drug-eluting beads TACE (DEBIRI-TACE), which are administered using the same approach. Numerous studies have shown that these different types of chemoembolization can be applied in different clinical settings safely. Furthermore, such treatments can also be combined with other local or systemic therapies. Unfortunately, due to the incoherent patient populations of studies investigating TACE in CRLM, critics state that the definite evidence supporting positive patient outcomes is still lacking. In the following article we review studies on conventional and DEBIRI-TACE. Although highly dependent on the clinical setting, prior therapies and generally the study population, cTACE and DEBIRI-TACE show comparable results. We present the most representative studies on the different chemoembolization procedures and compare the results. Although there is compelling evidence for both approaches, further studies are necessary to determine which patients profit most from these therapies.",

        "Based on the provided abstracts, Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) is a treatment option for unresectable colorectal cancer with liver metastasis (CRCLM). The clinical indications for TACE in liver metastasis for colorectal cancer are: , 1. Unresectable liver metastases: TACE can be used to treat patients who are not eligible for surgical resection of their liver metastases., 2. Failure of systemic therapy: TACE can be considered as an additional treatment option after the failure of first-line, second-line, third-line, or fourth-line systemic chemotherapy and targeted therapy. , In these situations, TACE with drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE) combined with systemic chemotherapy and targeted therapy may lead to a favorable disease control rate and survival outcomes in patients with CRCLM.",
        "The main indications for TACE are:\n* Unresectable or transiently resectable colorectal liver metastases\n* Achieving stable disease after initial chemotherapy\n* Improvement of the patient\u0027s performance status\n* To obtain a tumor response or to downstage the tumor burden before a planned curative surgery\n* To treat lesions that do not respond to systemic chemotherapy\n* To treat tumor recurrence after liver resection",
        "Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a locoregional therapy used in the palliative treatment of primary and secondary hepatic malignancies, including colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM). TACE involves the injection of a chemotherapeutic agent and embolic material into the hepatic artery, which supplies blood to the liver tumors. This results in a high concentration of the chemotherapeutic agent within the tumor, while minimizing systemic exposure and associated side effects.

Recently, encouraging data on short-course radiotherapy (SCRT) for rectal cancer has emerged. In this study, we aimed to compare these two methods in terms of short-term outcomes and cost analysis under the Korean medical insurance system.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-two patients with high-risk rectal cancer, who underwent either SCRT or LCRT followed by total mesorectal excision (TME), were classified into two groups. Twenty-seven patients received 5 Gy×5 with two cycles of XELOX (capecitabine 1000 mg/m² and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m² every 3 weeks) followed by TME (SCRT group). Thirty-five patients received capecitabine-based LCRT followed by TME (LCRT group). Short-term outcomes and cost estimation were assessed between the two groups.RESULTS: Pathological complete response was achieved in 18.5% and 5.7% of patients in the SCRT and LCRT groups, respectively (p\u003d0.223). The 2-year recurrence-free survival rate did not show significant difference between the two groups (SCRT vs. LCRT: 91.9% vs. 76.2%, p\u003d0.394). The average total cost per patient for SCRT was 18% lower for inpatient treatment (SCRT vs. LCRT: $18787 vs. $22203, p\u003c0.001) and 40% lower for outpatient treatment (SCRT vs. LCRT: $11955 vs. $19641, p\u003c0.001) compared to LCRT.

Current standards advise neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by radical surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Nationally, compliance with adjuvant chemotherapy is only 32%. New research evaluates the effectiveness of total neoadjuvant therapy: complete chemotherapy and chemoradiation before surgery.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the favored treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer by comparing the cost-effectiveness of total neoadjuvant therapy and the current standard of care.DESIGN: Decision analytical modeling using long-term costs and 5-year disease-free survival was performed to determine the cost-effectiveness after total neoadjuvant therapy and the current standard of care. Sensitivity analysis was used to investigate the effect of uncertainty in model parameters.SETTINGS: Centers for Medicare \u0026 Medicaid Services billing data perspective was adopted and outcomes modeled according to local and national databases and literature consensus.PATIENTS: Adult patients with stage II or III rectal cancer were selected.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness in disease-free life-years, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and net monetary benefit were determined over a 5-year posttreatment period. The favored strategy was determined based on cost-effectiveness and sensitivity analyses.RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness for total neoadjuvant therapy was 40,708 $/life-year, and, for conventional therapy, cost-effectiveness was 44,248 $/life-year.

Multiple randomised trials have shown a reduction in local recurrence rates with the addition of preoperative radiotherapy, either as a 1-week hypofractionated short-course (SCRT) or a conventionally fractionated long-course (LCRT) schedule with concurrent chemotherapy. There is also increasing interest in the addition of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to radiotherapy with the aim of improving disease-free survival. The relative use of SCRT and LCRT varies considerably across the world. This is reflected in, and is probably driven in part by, disparity between international guideline recommendations. In addition, different approaches to treatment may exist both between and within countries, with variation related to patient, disease and treatment centre and financial factors.",

        "Based on the provided abstracts, short-course radiation therapy (SCRT) appears to be a cost-effective therapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer. A cost-effectiveness analysis found that SCRT was the cost-effective strategy compared with long-course chemoradiotherapy, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $133,495 per quality-adjusted life-year. Another study conducted in Peru reported that SCRT-TNT regimens reduced costs by at least 50% compared to conventional chemoradiotherapy. Additionally, a phase 1 study demonstrated the safety and feasibility of neoadjuvant short-course RT concurrent with infusional 5-fluorouracil for locally advanced rectal cancer. Overall, these findings suggest that SCRT is a cost-effective and safe approach for the neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer.",
        "Short-course radiation therapy (SCRT) is a cost-effective therapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced distal rectal cancer, as shown in an analysis comparing it with long-course chemoradiotherapy (LCCRT). The study found that SCRT was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $133,495 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), while LCCRT had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $61,123 per QALY, assuming a greater proportion of patients with locally advanced distal tumors undergoing LCCRT would proceed to a more extensive surgery. SCRT with early surgery offers similar oncologic efficacy for locally advanced rectal cancer patients as compared to long-course chemoradiation with delayed surgery. Moreover, delaying surgery after SCRT decreases post-operative complications and improves tumor downstaging, offering the opportunity to administer neoadjuvant systemic therapy. A study comparing the cost-effectiveness of total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT), which involves complete chemotherapy and chemoradiation before surgery, with the current standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer found that TNT had a cost-effectiveness of 40,708 $/life-year, compared to 44,248 $/life-year for conventional therapy. Sensitivity analysis showed that TNT would remain the dominant strategy if the completion rate for total neoadjuvant therapy is 90% or higher, and the adjuvant chemotherapy completion rate is less than 93%.",
        "Yes, short-course radiation therapy is considered a cost-effective therapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer. Studies have shown that it incurs lower costs and improved quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared to conventional long-course chemoradiation followed by total mesorectal excision and adjuvant chemotherapy. Additionally, short-course radiation therapy has been found to be equivalent to long-course radiation therapy in terms of disease control outcomes, with the added benefits of increased patient convenience, lower acute toxicity, and improved cost-effectiveness. However, it is important to note that not all patients may be suitable for short-course radiation therapy, and individual patient factors should be taken into consideration when determining the most appropriate treatment approach.",
        "Yes, short-course radiation therapy (SCRT) is a cost-effective therapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer. Studies have shown that SCRT followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) and adjuvant chemotherapy is less expensive and improves quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared to conventional long-course chemoradiation (LCCRT) followed by TME and adjuvant chemotherapy. Additionally, SCRT is associated with higher compliance rates, flexibility in timing, and the ability to add neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy. SCRT is also equivalent to long-course radiation therapy in terms of tumor response and quality of life, and may provide additional benefits such as allowing for a transition to full dose systemic therapy in the neoadjuvant setting, selective organ preservation in complete responders, and providing a more convenient and cost-effective way of delivering pelvic radiation therapy.",

A systematic review by Colorectal Cancer Collaborative Group (CCCG) in 2017 also concluded that SCRT followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) is a valid treatment approach for patients with clinical stage II or III rectal cancer, offering potential benefits in terms of cost and convenience without compromising oncological outcomes.

Indeed, activating mutations in the genes KRAS, NRAS and BRAF are the only predictive biomarkers for anti-EGFR antibody therapy routinely tested the clinic for advanced stages of CRC. Gene expression signatures are important for clarifying the molecular mechanisms of CRC development and progression, but only two such tests for predicting recurrence risk are commercially available. The aim of our study was to propose a diagnostic approach based on mutation and gene expression analysis that can be routinely applied in the clinic for defining the most appropriate treatment strategy for each patient.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the distribution of the most common KRAS and BRAF mutations in Greek patients with colorectal cancer and their possible associations with clinical histopathological parameters. In this study, 322 and 188 colorectal carcinomas were used for the mutation analysis of KRAS (exon 2) and BRAF (exon 15) genes, respectively. The mutational status of both genes was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis. Although the overall frequency of KRAS mutations (36.6%) seemed to be similar to those reported for other populations, the rate of point mutations at codon 13 was significantly lower (12%) in Greek patients with colorectal cancer and associated with male gender (P \u003c 0.05). Tumors with G\u003eT codon 12 transversions and G\u003eC transitions showed more frequent lymph node metastasis (P \u003c 0.05, P \u003c 0.005, respectively). The rate of KRAS mutations gradually decreased with increasing histological grade (P \u003c 0.05), as opposed to BRAF mutations, which were strongly associated with poorly differentiated tumors (P \u003c 0.005).",

KRAS (codons 12, 13, and 61) and BRAF (codon 600) mutation status and MMR protein expression were analyzed in a consecutive series of 117 CRC samples using DNA pyrosequencing and immunohistochemistry. Tumor cell budding, infiltration pattern, and peritumoral lymphocytic (PTL) reaction was assessed applying established criteria. Molecular and morphological findings were correlated applying chi-square and Fisher\u0027s exact test. We found KRAS or BRAF mutations in 40 and 8 % of samples, while loss of MMR protein expression was observed in 11 %. Tumor budding was significantly associated with infiltrative growth, absence of PTLs, and blood and lymph vessel infiltration. Neither KRAS nor BRAF mutations were associated with a certain growth pattern or budding intensity of CRC, but loss of MMR protein expression was found in context with BRAF mutation, expanding growth, and presence of PTLs.",

This agent effectively targets a wide range of tyrosine kinases involved in cancer biology, such as those implicated in oncogenesis, angiogenesis, and tumor microenvironment control. The beneficial effects of regorafenib in clinical trials of patients who suffer from advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal cancer (CRC) or gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) refractory to standard treatments led to regorafenib monotherapy approval as a second-line treatment for advanced HCC and as a third-line treatment for advanced CRC and GISTs. Multiple in vitro and in vivo studies have been performed over the last decade to reveal the molecular mechanisms of the favorable actions exerted by regorafenib in patients. Given the hypothetical loss of sensitivity to regorafenib in tumor cells, preclinical research is also searching for novel therapeutic approaches consisting of co-administration of this drug plus other agents as a strategy to improve regorafenib effectiveness.",

For example, sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor targeting c-Raf and other oncogenic kinases, has been used clinically for treating advanced liver and kidney tumors, and also has shown efficacy against other malignancies. However, how inhibition of oncogenic signaling by sorafenib and other drugs suppresses tumor cell growth remains unclear. In this study, we found that sorafenib kills cancer cells by activating PUMA (p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis), a p53 target and a BH3-only Bcl-2 family protein. Sorafenib treatment induces PUMA in a variety of cancer cells irrespective of their p53 status. Surprisingly, the induction of PUMA by sorafenib is mediated by IκB-independent activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, which directly binds to the PUMA promoter to activate its transcription. NF-κB activation by sorafenib requires glycogen synthase kinase 3β activation, subsequent to ERK inhibition. Deficiency in PUMA abrogates sorafenib-induced apoptosis and caspase activation, and renders sorafenib resistance in colony formation and xenograft tumor assays. Furthermore, the chemosensitization effect of sorafenib is dependent on PUMA, and involves concurrent PUMA induction through different pathways. BH3 mimetics potentiate the anti-cancer effects of sorafenib, and restore sorafenib sensitivity in resistant cells. Together, these results demonstrate a key role of PUMA-dependent apoptosis in therapeutic inhibition of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling. They provide a rationale for manipulating the apoptotic machinery to improve sensitivity and overcome resistance to the therapies that target oncogenic kinase signal",

Mechanism of action was investigated using in vitro functional assays, immunohistochemistry and correlation with CRC-related oncogenes. Regorafenib demonstrated significant inhibition of growth-factor-mediated vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 2 and VEGFR3 autophosphorylation, and intracellular VEGFR3 signaling in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HuVECs) and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), and also blocked migration of LECs. Furthermore, regorafenib inhibited proliferation in 19 of 25 human CRC cell lines and markedly slowed tumor growth in five of seven PD xenograft models. Combination of regorafenib with irinotecan significantly delayed tumor growth after extended treatment in four xenograft models. Reduced CD31 staining indicates that the antiangiogenic effects of regorafenib contribute to its antitumor activity. Finally, regorafenib significantly delayed disease progression in a murine CRC liver metastasis model by inhibiting the growth of established liver metastases and preventing the formation of new metastases in other organs.

Most patients are affected by the autosomal dominant form (ADPKD) which generally is an adult-onset multisystem disorder. By contrast, the rarer recessive form ARPKD usually already manifests perinatally or in childhood. In some patients, however, ADPKD and ARPKD can phenotypically overlap with early manifestation in ADPKD and only late onset in ARPKD. Progressive fibrocystic renal changes are often accompanied by severe hepatobiliary changes or other extrarenal abnormalities.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) due to PKD1 or PKD2 mutations is the most common form, but other genes can be responsible for ADPKD and its phenocopies. Among them, a form of atypical ADPKD caused by DNAJB11 mutations (DNAJB11-PKD) has been recently described.Methods: We retrospectively recruited a cohort of 27 patients from six different families sharing common ancestries and harboring the same DNAJB11 mutation (c.100C\u003eT, p.Arg34*) and we compared it with a cohort of 42 typical ADPKD patients.Results: DNAJB11-PKD patients show small/normal-sized kidneys, with significantly smaller cysts and a slower progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) than ADPKD patients. In the DNAJB11-PKD cohort, the cystic phenotype could not be detected by ultrasound in about half of the patients, but all cases with available computed tomography/magnetic resonance scans displayed cysts.

ADPKD and ARPKD represent the leading genetic causes of renal disease in adults and children, respectively. ADPKD is caused by mutations in PKD1 encoding polycystin1 (PC1) and PKD2 encoding polycystin 2 (PC2). PC1/2 are multi-pass transmembrane proteins that form a complex localized in the primary cilium. Predominant ARPKD cases are caused by mutations in polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 (PKHD1) gene that encodes the Fibrocystin/Polyductin (FPC) protein, whereas a small subset of cases are caused by mutations in DAZ interacting zinc finger protein 1 like (DZIP1L) gene. FPC is a type I transmembrane protein, localizing to the cilium and basal body, in addition to other compartments, and DZIP1L encodes a transition zone/basal body protein. Apparently, PC1/2 and FPC are signaling molecules, while the mechanism that cilia employ to govern renal tubule morphology and prevent cyst formation is unclear.

In the current study, we assessed the expression of TOPO-1 and CES-2 in mCRC and analyzed its potential relevance to irinotecan based therapy. A total of 98 patients with mCRC were included in this study. The expression of TOPO-1 and CES-2 in mCRC tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. For TOPO-1, 46 patients showed high expression and 52 patients showed low expression. For CES-2, 53 patients showed high expression and 45 patients showed low expression. The correlation between TOPO-1 or CES-2 expression and clinicopathological characteristics of mCRC patients was analyzed. Neither TOPO-1 nor CES-2 had significant correlation with age, gender, tumor site, tumor grade and metastatic sites in mCRC patients. However, high expression of CES-2 but not TOP-1 was positively correlated with better curative effect. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test were applied to assess the correlation between progression-free survival (PFS)/overall survival (OS) and TOPO-1 or CES-2 expression in mCRC patients. High expression of TOPO-1 and CES-2 are correlated with longer PFS and OS. In summary, our findings suggest that TOPO-1 and CES-2 may play important roles irinotecan sensitivity in mCRC patients.",

However, irinotecan has several clinically significant side effects, including diarrhea, which limit its clinical utility and efficacy in many patients. In an effort to discover better and improved pharmacotherapy against colorectal cancer, we synthesized a novel topoisomerase inhibitor, PCC0208037, examined its anti-tumor efficacy and related molecular mechanisms, and characterized its toxicity and pharmacokinetic profiles. PCC0208037 suppressed colorectal cancer cell (CRC) proliferation and increased cell cycle arrest, which may be related to its effects on up-regulating DNA damage response (DDR)-related molecules and apoptosis-related proteins. PCC0208037 demonstrated robust anti-tumor activity in vivo in a colorectal cancer cell xenograft model, which was comparable to or slightly better than CPT-11. In a preliminary toxicology study, PCC0208037 demonstrated much weaker tissue damage to colorectal tissue than CPT-11, and its impacts on food intake and body weight loss were more transient and recovered faster than CPT-11 in mice. This could be partially explained by the pharmacokinetic findings, which showed that PCC0208037 and its active metabolite, SN-38, were more accumulated in tumor tissue than in the intestine, as compared to CPT-11.",

We tested ABCG2 and topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) mRNA expression as predictive biomarkers for irinotecan benefit in the PETACC-3 patient cohort. The present study included 580 patients with mRNA expression data from Stage III colon cancer samples from the PETACC-3 study, which randomized the patients to Fluorouracil/leucovorin (5FUL) +/- irinotecan. The primary end-points were recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Patients were divided into one group with high ABCG2 expression (above median) and low TOP-1 expression (below 75 percentile) (\"resistant\") (n \u003d 216) and another group including all other combinations of these two genes (\"sensitive\") (n \u003d 364). The rationale for the cut-offs were based on the distribution of expression levels in the PETACC-3 Stage II set of patients, where ABCG2 was unimodal and TOP1 was bimodal with a high expression level mode in the top quarter of the patients. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the hazard ratios and the association between variables and end-points and log-rank tests to assess the statistical significance of differences in survival between groups. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival functions were used for visualization and estimation of survival rates at specific time points. Significant differences were found for both RFS (Hazard ratio (HR): 0.63 (0.44-0.92); p \u003d 0.016) and OS (HR: 0.60 (0.39-0.93); p \u003d 0.02) between the two biomarker groups when the patients received FOLFIRI (5FUL+irinotecan).

Response rate for this class of drug varies from 10% to 30%, and there is no predictive biomarker for patient stratification by response. On the basis of our understanding of CPT drug resistance mechanisms, we developed an immunohistochemistry-based predictive test, P-topoI-Dx, to stratify the patient population into those who did and did not experience a response.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The retrospective validation studies included a training set (n \u003d 79) and a validation cohort (n \u003d 27) of gastric cancer (GC) patients, and 8 cohorts of colorectal cancer (CRC) patient tissue (n \u003d 176). Progression-free survival for 6 months was considered a positive response to CPT-based therapy. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded slides were immunohistochemically stained with anti-phospho-specific topoI-Serine10 (topoI-pS10), quantitated, and analyzed statistically.RESULTS: We determined a threshold of 35% positive staining to offer optimal test characteristics in GC. The GC (n \u003d 79) training set demonstrated 76.6% (95% confidence interval, 64-86) sensitivity; 68.8% (41-88) specificity; positive predictive value (PPV) 92.5% (81-98); and negative predictive value (NPV) 42.3% (24-62).

However, its usefulness is limited by the pre-existing or inevitable development of resistance. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCG2/breast cancer resistance protein (BRCP) through its function in xenobiotic clearance might play an important role in irinotecan resistance. With a goal to evaluate the clinical significance of ABCG2 measurements, we here review the current literature on ABCG2 in relation to irinotecan treatment in CRC patients.RESULTS: Few studies have evaluated the association between ABCG2 gene or protein expression and prognosis in CRC patients. Discordant results were reported. The discrepancies might be explained by the use of different criteria for interpretation of results in the immunohistochemistry studies. Only one large study evaluated the ABCG2 protein expression and efficacy of irinotecan in mCRC (CAIRO study, n \u003d 566). This study failed to demonstrate any correlation between ABCG2 protein expression in the primary tumor and response to irinotecan-based treatment.

Among these 108 were eligible for analyses and thus entered the study. Primary tumors samples were collected and tissue microarray (TMA) blocks were produced. FISH analysis was performed using two probe-mixes: TOP1/CEN-20 and TOP1/CEN-2. Only samples harboring all three signals (TOP1, CEN-20 and CEN-2) using FISH were included in the analyses.RESULTS: In the TOP1/CEN-20 probe-mix the median TOP1- and CEN-20 CN were 4.46 (range: 1.5-9.5) and 2.00 (range: 0.55-4.55), respectively.

We have published that the deregulated DNA-PKcs kinase cascade ensures rapid degradation of topoI and is at the core of the drug resistance mechanism of topoI inhibitors, including irinotecan. We also identified CTD small phosphatase 1 (CTDSP1) (a nuclear phosphatase) as a primary upstream regulator of DNA-PKcs in response to topoI inhibitors.

        "Based on the provided abstracts, it appears that topoisomerase I (TOP1) copy number alterations may be associated with response to irinotecan in metastatic colorectal cancer patients. In one study, a borderline significant association was observed between increasing TOP1 copy number and objective response to irinotecan. However, the ratios of TOP1/CEN-20 and TOP1/CEN-2 did not provide additional information for patient stratification. Another study developed an immunohistochemistry-based predictive test, P-topoI-Dx, which demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity in identifying patients who responded to camptothecin-based therapy, including irinotecan. Overall, tumor expression of TOP1 may be a promising biomarker of response to irinotecan in colorectal cancer patients, but further validation is needed.",
        "Tumor expression of topoisomerase I (TOPO-1) may be a potential biomarker of response to irinotecan-based chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In a study of 98 mCRC patients, high expression of TOPO-1 was found to be positively correlated with better curative effect and longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients who underwent irinotecan chemotherapy. However, TOPO-1 expression was not significantly correlated with age, gender, tumor site, tumor grade, or metastatic sites in mCRC patients. Additionally, a separate study examining biomarker-guided treatment for patients with colon cancer found that patients with high ABCG2 expression and low TOP-1 expression had worse recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) when treated with irinotecan-based therapy. These findings suggest that TOPO-1 expression may be a useful biomarker for predicting response to irinotecan-based therapy in mCRC patients.",
        "Yes, tumor expression of Topoisomerase I (Top1) has been identified as a potential biomarker for response to irinotecan therapy in colorectal cancer patients. Preliminary data suggest that gene expression levels of Top1 may be predictive of response to therapy with irinotecan. In a study, the biopsies of the untreated tumor tissue of responding patients showed a significant higher expression of Top1 compared with nonresponding patients. Another study demonstrated a borderline significant association between a stepwise increase in the TOP1 signal count and objective response. Despite limitations of the study, the positive associations between TOP1 and objective response suggest that further analysis in larger tumor material is warranted. However, it is controversial whether the response to irinotecan could be predicted by the expression level of Top1.",
        "The expression level of topoisomerase-I (Topo I) in colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors has been studied as a potential biomarker for predicting response to irinotecan-based therapy. Preliminary data suggests that higher Topo I expression in untreated tumor tissue may be associated with a better response to irinotecan-based chemoradiation. However, other studies have not found a significant association between Topo I expression and response to irinotecan-based therapy. Therefore, the use of Topo I expression as a biomarker for predicting response to irinotecan in CRC patients is still a topic of ongoing research and not yet established in clinical practice.",

Additionally, TOP1 expression decreased significantly during treatment in responders. Another study found a borderline significant association between increasing TOP1 copy number and objective response to irinotecan therapy in breast cancer patients.

        "Based on the abstract, yes, tumor expression of Topoisomerase I (Topo I) is associated with improved outcome in patients with resected colorectal cancer treated with irinotecan-containing adjuvant chemotherapy. In the multivariate analysis, Topo I expression was found to be associated with a reduced risk of death (HR \u003d 0.61, p \u003d 0.009). Moreover, in the subgroup of patients who received irinotecan-containing chemotherapy, those with Topo I expression had better overall survival (HR \u003d 0.47, p \u003d 0.033). These findings suggest that Topo I tumor expression may be a biomarker for predicting response to irinotecan therapy in colorectal cancer patients. However, as the authors conclude, randomized prospective trials are needed to confirm these results.",
        "Yes, tumor expression of Topoisomerase I (Top1) has been identified as a potential biomarker for response to irinotecan therapy in colorectal cancer patients. Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor that blocks the Top1 enzyme, leading to DNA damage and cell death. The inhibition of Top1 by irinotecan is achieved by trapping a subset of Top1-DNA cleavage complexes, specifically those with a guanine +1 in the DNA sequence. Top1 is a DNA topoisomerase that controls and alters the topologic states of DNA during transcription. It is encoded by the TOP1 gene, which is located on chromosome 20. The enzyme catalyzes the transient breaking and rejoining of a single strand of DNA, allowing the broken strand to rotate around the intact strand and altering the topology of DNA. Irinotecan inactivation of Top1 has been shown to be synthetically lethal in combination with deficiencies in expression of specific DNA repair genes, such as the DNA repair WRN gene and the DNA repair MRE11 gene. This synthetic lethality has been observed in patients with colon cancer, with irinotecan being more strongly beneficial for patients with hypermethylated WRN promoters compared to those with unmethylated WRN promoters. In addition, irinotecan inactivation of Top1 may be synthetically lethal with deficient expression of DNA repair gene ATM, which is frequently hypermethylated in many cancers. A 2016 study showed that low expression of the ATM protein in gastric cancer cells in vitro and in a mouse model caused increased sensitivity to inactivation by irinotecan compared to cells with high expression of ATM. Overall, the evidence suggests that Top1 expression may be a useful biomarker for predicting response to irinotecan therapy in colorectal cancer patients, particularly in those with deficiencies in specific DNA repair genes. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the clinical utility of Top1 expression as a biomarker.",

Slovakia, the Netherlands, and New Zealand had the highest age-standardised incidence rates in 2017. Greenland, Hungary, and Slovakia had the highest age-standardised death rates in 2017. Numbers of incident cases and deaths were higher among males than females up to the ages of 80-84 years, with the highest rates observed in the oldest age group (≥95 years) for both sexes in 2017. There was a non-linear association between the Socio-demographic Index and the Healthcare Access and Quality Index and age-standardised DALY rates. In 2017, the three largest contributors to DALYs at the global level, for both sexes, were diet low in calcium (20·5% [12·9-28·9]), alcohol use (15·2% [12·1-18·3]), and diet low in milk (14·3% [5·1-24·8]).INTERPRETATION: There is substantial global v",

However, this was primarily on the basis of single-agent EGFRi trials and little is known about the resistance mechanisms of EGFRi combined with effective cytotoxic chemotherapy in previously untreated patients.METHODS: We analyzed paired plasma samples from patients with RAS/BRAF/EGFR wild-type metastatic CRC enrolled in three large randomized trials evaluating EGFRi in the first line in combination with chemotherapy and as a single agent in third line. The mutational signature of the alterations acquired with therapy was evaluated. CRC cell lines with resistance to cetuximab, infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin, and SN38 were developed, and transcriptional changes profiled.RESULTS: Patients whose tumors were treated with and responded to EGFRi alone were more likely to develop acquired mutations (46%) compared with those treated in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy (9%). Furthermore, contrary to the generally accepted hypothesis of the clonal evolution of acquired resistance, we demonstrate that baseline resistant subclonal mutations rarely expanded to become clonal at progression, and most remained subclonal or disappeared. Consistent with this clinical finding, preclinical models with acquired resistance to either cetuximab or chemotherapy were cross-resistant to the alternate agents, with transcriptomic profiles consistent with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. By contrast, commonly acquired resistance alterations in the MAPK pathway do not affect sensitivity t",

Therefore, understanding the mechanistic basis of acquired resistance to targeted therapies represents a major challenge to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with CRC.

          "text": "A main limitation of therapies that selectively target kinase signalling pathways is the emergence of secondary drug resistance. Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody that binds the extracellular domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is effective in a subset of KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancers. After an initial response, secondary resistance invariably ensues, thereby limiting the clinical benefit of this drug. The molecular bases of secondary resistance to cetuximab in colorectal cancer are poorly understood. Here we show that molecular alterations (in most instances point mutations) of KRAS are causally associated with the onset of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR treatment in colorectal cancers. Expression of mutant KRAS under the control of its endogenous gene promoter was sufficient to confer cetuximab resistance, but resistant cells remained sensitive to combinatorial inhibition of EGFR and mitogen-activated protein-kinase kinase (MEK). Analysis of metastases from patients who developed resistance to cetuximab or panitumumab showed the emergence of KRAS amplification in one sample and acquisition of secondary KRAS mutations in 60% (6 out of 10) of the cases. KRAS mutant alleles were detectable in the blood of cetuximab-treated patients as early as 10 months before radiographic documentation of disease progression. In summary, the results identify KRAS mutations as frequent drivers of acquired resistance to cetuximab in colorectal cancers, indicate that the emergence of KRAS mutant clones can be detected non-invasively months before radiographic progression and suggest early initiation of a MEK inhibitor as a rational strategy for delaying or reversing drug resistance.",

However, a significant number of patients suffer from primary or acquired resistance. RAS mutations are negative predictors of clinical efficacy of anti-EGFR antibodies in patients with mCRC. Oncogenic RAS activates the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways, which are considered the main effectors of resistance. However, the relative impact of these pathways in RAS-mutant CRC is less defined. A better mechanistic understanding of RAS-mediated resistance may guide development of rational intervention strategies. To this end we developed cancer models for functional dissection of resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in vitro and in vivo. To selectively activate MAPK- or AKT-signaling we expressed conditionally activatable RAF-1 and AKT in cancer cells. We found that either pathway independently protected sensitive cancer models against anti-EGFR antibody treatment in vitro and in vivo. RAF-1- and AKT-mediated resistance was associated with increased expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins. Biomarkers of MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathway activation correlated with inferior outcome in a cohort of mCRC patients receiving cetuximab-based therapy. Dual pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K and MEK successfully sensitized primary resistant CRC models to anti-EGFR therapy. In conclusion, combined targeting of MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling, but not single pathways, may be required to enhance the efficacy of anti-EGFR antibody therapy in patients with RAS-mutated CRC as well as in RAS wild type tumors with clinical resistance.",

Despite these efforts, additional mechanisms of resistance to EGFR blockade are thought to be present in colorectal cancer and little is known about determinants of sensitivity to this therapy. To examine the effect of somatic genetic changes in colorectal cancer on response to anti-EGFR antibody therapy, here we perform complete exome sequence and copy number analyses of 129 patient-derived tumour grafts and targeted genomic analyses of 55 patient tumours, all of which were KRAS wild-type. We analysed the response of tumours to anti-EGFR antibody blockade in tumour graft models and in clinical settings and functionally linked therapeutic responses to mutational data. In addition to previously identified genes, we detected mutations in ERBB2, EGFR, FGFR1, PDGFRA, and MAP2K1 as potential mechanisms of primary resistance to this therapy. Novel alterations in the ectodomain of EGFR were identified in patients with acquired resistance to EGFR blockade. Amplifications and sequence changes in the tyrosine kinase receptor adaptor gene IRS2 were identified in tumours with increased sensitivity to anti-EGFR therapy.

After an initial response, secondary resistance invariably ensues, thereby limiting the clinical benefit of this drug. The molecular bases of secondary resistance to cetuximab in colorectal cancer are poorly understood. Here we show that molecular alterations (in most instances point mutations) of KRAS are causally associated with the onset of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR treatment in colorectal cancers. Expression of mutant KRAS under the control of its endogenous gene promoter was sufficient to confer cetuximab resistance, but resistant cells remained sensitive to combinatorial inhibition of EGFR and mitogen-activated protein-kinase kinase (MEK). Analysis of metastases from patients who developed resistance to cetuximab or panitumumab showed the emergence of KRAS amplification in one sample and acquisition of secondary KRAS mutations in 60% (6 out of 10) of the cases. KRAS mutant alleles were detectable in the blood of cetuximab-treated patients as early as 10 months before radiographic documentation of disease progression.",

However, the generation of primary and secondary resistance to anti-EGFR mAbs has become an important factor restricting its efficacy. Recent studies have revealed that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), especially long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), are implicated in anti-EGFR antibodies resistance, affecting the sensitivity of CRC cells to Cetuximab and Panitumumab.

However, a significant number of patients suffer from primary or acquired resistance. RAS mutations are negative predictors of clinical efficacy of anti-EGFR antibodies in patients with mCRC. Oncogenic RAS activates the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways, which are considered the main effectors of resistance. However, the relative impact of these pathways in RAS-mutant CRC is less defined. A better mechanistic understanding of RAS-mediated resistance may guide development of rational intervention strategies. To this end we developed cancer models for functional dissection of resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in vitro and in vivo. To selectively activate MAPK- or AKT-signaling we expressed conditionally activatable RAF-1 and AKT in cancer cells. We found that either pathway independently protected sensitive cancer models against anti-EGFR antibody treatment in vitro and in vivo. RAF-1- and AKT-mediated resistance was associated with increased expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins. Biomarkers of MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathway activation correlated with inferior outcome in a cohort of mCRC patients receiving cetuximab-based therapy. Dual pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K and MEK successfully sensitized primary resistant CRC models to anti-EGFR therapy.",

On the other, membrane localization of the lipid kinase PIK3CA counteracts PTEN and promotes AKT1 phosphorylation, thereby activating a parallel intracellular axis. Constitutive activation of KRAS bypasses the corresponding signaling cascade and, accordingly, patients with mCRC bearing KRAS mutations are clinically resistant to therapy with panitumumab or cetuximab. We hypothesized that mutations activating PIK3CA could also preclude responsiveness to EGFR-targeted moAbs through a similar mechanism. Here, we present the mutational analysis of PIK3CA and KRAS and evaluation of the PTEN protein status in a cohort of 110 patients with mCRC treated with anti-EGFR moAbs.

Upregulation of other EGFR family members like HER2 or HER3 that can dimerize with EGFR\n4. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition that reduces dependence on EGFR signaling\n\nThese resistance mechanisms often co-exist and can derive from rare pre-existing resistant clones that expand under the selective pressure of anti-EGFR therapy. Combination therapies targeting multiple resistance pathways in addition to EGFR may help overcome secondary resistance.",
        "The mechanisms of secondary resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab and panitumumab, in colorectal cancer treatment include genetic alterations of genes in the EGFR-RAS-RAF-MEK signaling pathway and receptor tyrosine kinases. Specifically, KRAS mutations are a frequent driver of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy, with emergence of KRAS amplification or acquisition of secondary KRAS mutations in many cases. Additionally, molecular profiling has identified alterations in other genes that converge on the (re)activation of MEK-ERK or AKT pathways, leading to resistance. These mechanisms can be detected through circulating tumor DNA and patient-derived xenografts, allowing for monitoring of patients and testing of combination therapies to overcome or reverse resistance.",

We assessed the utility of a validated pediatric prognostic tool called PERSEVERE II that uses decision tree methodology to predict mortality at discharge in neonates who experienced sepsis.METHODS: Prospective study in a dual-center cohort of neonates with sepsis admitted between June 2020 and December 2021. Biomarker analysis was done on serum samples obtained at the time of evaluation for the event.RESULTS: In a cohort of 59 neonates with a mortality rate of 15.3%, PERSEVERE II was 67% sensitive and 59% specific for mortality, p 0.27. Amongst PERSEVERE II biomarkers, IL-8 showed good prognostic performance for mortality prediction with a cutoff of 300 pg/mL (sensitivity 100%, specificity 65%, negative predictive value 100%, AUC 0.87, p 0.0003).

This systematic review aimed to revise and update the state of knowledge regarding the potential role of vitamin D and calcium as key factors involved in the prevention and treatment of CRC. A literature search was performed in PubMed and Web of Science. A total of eight studies were finally included in the present review. Vitamin D showed a protective role by promoting transcriptomic changes associated with antitumor effects. However, no significant effects of vitamin D were noted in the relapse-free survival of patients at 5 years. On the other hand, previous scientific evidence demonstrated that calcium regulates the expression of colonic proteins that decrease cell proliferation and increase cell differentiation. Nevertheless, an increased risk of associated serrated adenomas was found in response to calcium and calcium + vitamin D supplementation. Moreover, supplementation with both nutrients showed positive changes on relevant CRC biomarkers including TGFα, TGFβ1, APC, β-catenin and E-cadherin.",

A total of 119,501 participants aged 40-69 years recruited between 2004 and 2013 were included in this analysis. The calcium intake level was categorized using the Dietary Reference Intakes for Koreans (KDRIs). The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for colorectal cancer risk, adjusting for potential confounders.RESULTS: In the multivariable-adjusted model, compared with the group that consumed less than the recommended amount of calcium, the group that consumed more than the recommended intake of calcium showed a significant reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer in women.

During an average 11.3 yr of follow-up of 61,463 women, we observed 572 incident cases of colorectal cancer. Using data obtained from a 67-item food frequency questionnaire and Cox proportional hazards models to estimate rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals, we found an inverse association between dietary calcium intake and colorectal cancer risk.

Oral calcium supplementation has been proposed as a dietary intervention for individuals at high risk of colorectal cancer because of its ability to reduce rectal epithelial cell proliferation through the binding of fatty and bile acids. Placebo-controlled studies, however, have yielded varying results.PURPOSE: We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to test oral calcium supplementation in patients at high risk of developing hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer.METHODS: Thirty subjects at risk for this cancer, with an increased epithelial cell proliferation along the colon and rectum, were randomly assigned to either a placebo group (n \u003d 15) or a treatment group (n \u003d 15). They received either oral calcium carbonate (CaCO3) supplements (1.5 g) or placebo (cellulose and starch) three times a day during a 12-week period. Colonic biopsy specimens (rectal, sigmoidal, and descending) were obtained prior to and after the intervention trial, during endoscopy, for determination of labeling index (LI) of whole crypts and crypt compartments by 5-bromo-2\u0027-deoxyuridine incorporation and immunohistochemistry. Proportional bile acid compositions in duodenal bile and cytolytic activity of fecal water were also determined. All P values represent two-tailed tests of statistical significance.RESULTS: Statistically significant reductions, comparing before with after intervention, in rectal whole-crypt LI after receiving either calcium supplements (from 10.9% +/- 5.2% [mean +/- SD] to 6.2% +/- 1.5%; P \u003c .02) or placebo (from 11.7% +/- 4.7% to 8.2% +/- 3.1%; P \u003c .05) were observed. In the three bowel segments, no statistically significant differences were observed between the supplemental calcium and placebo groups. A statistically significant reduction in cytolytic activity was determined during calcium supplementation (from 57% +/- 41% to 32% +/- 30%; P \u003c .05), whereas in the placebo group, it did not change (from 42% +/- 41% to 36% +/- 27%; P \u003e .10).CONCLUSIONS: Oral calcium supplementation was shown to cause only a minor nonstatistically significant reduction of epithelial cell proliferation in the rectum, compared with placebo, and to have no effect on the same parameter in the sigmoid and descending colon in first-degree relatives of her",

        "According to the provided abstracts, the evidence suggests that calcium dietary supplementation may contribute to a moderate degree to the prevention of colorectal adenomatous polyps. However, this does not constitute sufficient evidence to recommend the general use of calcium supplements to prevent colorectal cancer. The systematic review found a reduction in the development of recurrent colorectal adenoma (OR 0.74, CI 0.58,0.95) when combining the results from two well-designed trials. Another study found that high dietary calcium intake (\u003e1485mg/day) was associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer, but this association may be modified by genetic variation associated with serum calcium concentrations. Overall, while there is some evidence suggesting a potential benefit, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between calcium supplementation and colorectal cancer prevention.",
        "Calcium dietary supplementation may potentially reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, as suggested by a study that found an inverse association between postdiagnostic total calcium intake and colorectal cancer-specific mortality. The study compared the highest with the lowest quartile intake of postdiagnostic total calcium and found that the multivariable hazard ratio for colorectal cancer-specific mortality was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.32-0.96; P trend \u003d 0.04). Additionally, postdiagnostic supplemental calcium intake was also inversely associated with colorectal cancer-specific mortality, with a multivariable hazard ratio of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.42-1.06; P trend \u003d 0.047). However, these inverse associations were primarily observed in women, and calcium from diet or dairy sources was associated with lower risk in men. Another study found that higher dietary calcium intake was significantly associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer in women, but not in men. Therefore, calcium dietary supplementation may potentially reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, particularly in women, but more research is needed to confirm these findings.",
        "Yes, calcium dietary supplementation can reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. Studies have shown that higher intake of calcium is associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer. The protective effect of calcium is thought to be due to its ability to bind to bile acids and fatty acids in the colon, reducing their ability to damage the colon lining and promote cancer development. Additionally, calcium may also have a direct effect on colon cells, promoting their normal growth and differentiation. However, it is important to note that the evidence for the protective effect of calcium is not conclusive and more research is needed to confirm these findings.",
        "Yes, calcium dietary supplementation has been shown to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in several studies. A meta-analysis of 14 prospective cohort studies found that high calcium intake was associated with a 25% reduction in colorectal cancer risk. Additionally, a randomized controlled trial found that 9 months of high-dose wheat bran fiber and calcium carbonate supplementation in participants with a history of recently resected colorectal cancer was associated with a 25% reduction in risk of colorectal cancer. The mechanisms by which calcium may reduce colorectal cancer risk are not fully understood, but may involve the inhibition of colonic hyperproliferation and the promotion of apoptosis in colonic epithelial cells. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal dosage and duration of calcium supplementation for colorectal cancer prevention.",
        "Yes, calcium dietary supplementation can reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. A study found that calcium intake was significantly, inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk. Another study reported that individuals with \u003eor\u003d1000IU/day oral Vitamin D or \u003eor\u003d33ng/ml (82nmol/l) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D had 50% lower incidence of colorectal cancer compared to reference values. The findings support the hypothesis of protective roles for calcium, vitamin D, and dairy products in the risk of colorectal cancer.",
        "No, calcium dietary supplementation has not been proven to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. While some studies suggest that calcium may have a role in colorectal cancer prevention, the evidence is not conclusive. A meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials found no significant reduction in colorectal cancer risk with calcium supplementation. Additionally, a randomized controlled trial of calcium supplementation in individuals with a history of colorectal adenomas found no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent adenomas. Therefore, it is not recommended to take calcium supplements specifically for the purpose of reducing colorectal cancer risk.",
        "Based on the provided abstracts, it appears that calcium dietary supplementation may have a moderate degree of prevention against colorectal adenomatous polyps. A systematic review of two randomized controlled trials found that calcium supplementation reduced the development of recurrent colorectal adenoma (OR 0.74, CI 0.58,0.95). Additionally, a study in mice showed that increased dietary calcium was associated with induced apoptosis in normal distal colonic epithelium, which might contribute to its potential chemopreventive role in colorectal carcinogenesis. However, the evidence is not yet sufficient to recommend the general use of calcium supplements for preventing colorectal cancer. Further studies are needed to fully understand the relationship between calcium supplementation and colorectal cancer risk reduction.",
        "Yes, calcium dietary supplementation has been shown to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in several studies. The evidence suggests that calcium intake is inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk, with a significant reduction in risk observed for high levels of dietary calcium consumption. The mechanism by which calcium may reduce colorectal cancer risk is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the inhibition of cell proliferation and the promotion of apoptosis in colonic epithelial cells. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal level of calcium intake for colorectal cancer prevention.",
        "500 mg/d of calcium can decrease the risk of colorectal cancer in people with a history of adenoma, but further studies are needed to confirm the results and to evaluate the effect on the general population",
        "Calcium dietary supplementation might reduce the risk of colorectal adenomatous polyps, but not enough evidence exists yet for recommending general use of calcium supplements to prevent colorectal cancer. High dietary calcium intake could be associated with lower risks; however, more research is necessary to understand this relationship fully.",
        "Yes, calcium dietary supplementation can reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. Several studies have found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower incidence of colorectal cancer:\n\n- Calcium intake was significantly, inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk in a dose-response manner. The highest vs lowest quintile of calcium intake had a 36% lower risk.\n\n- Administration of supplemental calcium may have a significant effect on reducing colonic polyp and colon cancer incidence. \n\n- Results from a large study support the hypothesis that calcium modestly reduces risk of colorectal cancer.\n\n- Calcium intake, along with vitamin D, appears to play a protective role in reducing the risk of colorectal cancer.\n\nThe evidence suggests calcium supplementation, especially in combination with vitamin D, can help prevent colorectal cancer. A dose-response relationship has been observed, with higher calcium intake providing greater risk reduction.",
        "The evidence suggests that calcium dietary supplementation might contribute to a moderate degree to the prevention of colorectal adenomatous polyps, but it is not sufficient to recommend the general use of calcium supplements to prevent colorectal cancer. Two well-designed trials with 13,446 subjects found a reduction in recurrent colorectal adenoma with calcium supplementation (OR 0.74, CI 0.58-0.95). However, other studies have inconsistent results, and it is unclear whether the decrease in labeling index correlates with a decrease in occurrence or recurrence of colonic tumors. Additionally, a recent study found that only high dietary calcium intake (\u003e1485 mg/day) was associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer, but supplementation had no significant effect. Further replication in other studies is needed to confirm these findings.",
        "Based on the evidence from multiple studies, calcium dietary supplementation may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, but the effect appears to be modest. Several studies found an inverse association between higher calcium intake and colorectal cancer incidence. Calcium, along with vitamin D, may play a protective role through a joint action in colorectal carcinogenesis.\n\nHowever, while the evidence suggests calcium supplementation could be beneficial, the magnitude of risk reduction is not definitive. More research is needed to establish clear recommendations on dosage and to determine the extent of protection provided by calcium supplements alone versus in combination with vitamin D.\n\nIn summary, calcium supplementation shows promise as part of a preventive strategy against colorectal cancer, but should be considered alongside other important lifestyle factors like a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. The benefits of supplementation must be weighed against potential risks on an individual basis. Current evidence supports a modest protective effect, but is not conclusive enough to universally recommend calcium supplements solely for colorectal cancer prevention.",
        "Based on the information provided, it is not possible to conclude that calcium dietary supplementation can reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. The first abstract describes a case-control study showing an inverse relationship between dietary calcium intake and colorectal cancer risk in a Korean population with relatively low calcium intake. However, a randomized controlled trial described in the second abstract found no significant difference in colorectal cancer incidence between women who received calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and those who received placebo. A meta-analysis of observational studies in the third abstract suggests that higher consumption of milk/dairy products reduces the risk of colon cancer, and high calcium intake reduces the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), but it does not specifically evaluate calcium supplementation. Therefore, more research is needed to determine whether calcium dietary supplementation can reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.",
        "Daily supplementation of calcium with vitamin D for seven years did not affect the overall incidence of colorectal cancer among postmenopausal women. However, high calcium intake was found to have a greater protective effect against tumors of the distal colon and rectal cancer compared to proximal colon cancer. The risk reduction associated with calcium was similar for both dietary and supplemental sources. Additionally, calcium consumption was inversely related to colorectal cancer risk in a Korean population, where the national average calcium intake level is lower than in Western countries. Therefore, while calcium dietary supplementation may not reduce the overall risk of colorectal cancer, it could potentially have a protective effect against certain sub-sites of the colon and rectal cancer, and its risk reduction effects may be more pronounced in populations with lower calcium intake levels.",
        "No, daily supplementation of calcium with vitamin D for seven years had no effect on the incidence of colorectal cancer among postmenopausal women. The long latency associated with the development of colorectal cancer, along with the seven-year duration of the trial, may have contributed to this null finding. Ongoing follow-up will assess the longer-term effect of this intervention.",
        "The evidence on the effect of calcium dietary supplementation on colorectal cancer risk is mixed. Some studies suggest that high calcium intake, from both dietary and supplemental sources, may have a protective effect against colorectal cancer, particularly in the distal colon and rectum. However, other studies have found no effect of calcium supplementation on colorectal cancer risk. The inconsistency in findings may be due to differences in study design, population characteristics, and the duration and dose of calcium supplementation. More research is needed to determine the role of calcium supplementation in colorectal cancer prevention.",
        "Calcium dietary supplementation has been shown to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, particularly in the distal colon and rectal cancer. However, the null finding in a recent trial among postmenopausal women may be due to the long latency associated with colorectal cancer development and the duration of the trial. Further follow-up is needed to assess the longer-term effect of calcium supplementation on colorectal cancer risk. Additionally, the inverse association between calcium consumption and colorectal cancer risk has been observed in various populations, including Korean men and women. While procalcitonin can guide the identification of children at higher risk of morbidity and mortality, the optimal monitoring and treatment strategies for these individuals are not yet clear. Finally, while CT colonography may be more costly and result in more deaths than colonoscopy, the latter remains the dominant strategy for colorectal cancer screening in Canada.",
        "Yes, several studies suggest that calcium intake, either through diet or supplements, can potentially reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. However, the protective effect seems to be more significant for tumors of the distal colon and rectal cancer compared to the proximal colon. It\u0027s also worth noting that a seven-year trial found no effect of daily supplementation of calcium with vitamin D on the incidence of colorectal cancer among postmenopausal women, suggesting that the impact of calcium may vary depending on other factors such as age, gender, and the specific location of the cancer within the colon",
        "The evidence on the association between calcium dietary supplementation and the risk of colorectal cancer is not conclusive. Some studies suggest that calcium may help reduce the risk by binding to bile and fatty acids in the gut, but other studies have not found a significant association. High calcium intake may have a greater protective effect against tumors of the distal colon and rectal cancer compared to proximal colon. However, excessive calcium intake can lead to hypercalcemia, which may cause symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Therefore, it is recommended to maintain appropriate calcium levels through a balanced diet and, if necessary, supplementation under the guidance of a healthcare professional.",
        "While randomized clinical trials have not found a significant reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer, a meta-analysis of prospective studies suggested a modest reduction of 15% in colorectal cancer risk in people with the highest intakes of calcium.",
        "Yes, calcium dietary supplementation may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, especially in postmenopausal women. However, the effectiveness of calcium supplementation may depend on the individual\u0027s calcium intake level and the duration of supplementation",
        "Based on available studies and a meta-analysis, there isn\u0027t sufficient evidence that calcium dietary supplementation reduces the risk of colorectal cancer. Some observational studies suggest an inverse relationship between calcium intake from dairy products and CRC risk, but this association is not definitive in randomized controlled trials or when specifically assessing calcium supplementation. More research is needed to confirm a direct protective effect of calcium dietary supplements against colorectal cancer.",
        "The mixed data on the impact of calcium supplementation for reducing colorectal cancer risk shows no significant effect from a study involving postmenopausal women over seven years, though this could be due to trial length and latency. However, high calcium intake is linked with greater protective effects against distal colon and rectal cancers, and the inverse relationship between calcium consumption and colorectal cancer risk has been observed in a Korean population with lower national average calcium intake levels. A decreased colorectal cancer risk associated with calcium was also seen across all subgroups studied.",
        "Calcium dietary supplementation has been shown to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, particularly in the distal colon and rectal cancer. However, the effect of calcium supplementation on colorectal cancer risk is not consistent across all studies and may depend on the source of calcium (dietary vs. supplemental) and the duration of supplementation. While some studies have found no effect of calcium supplementation on colorectal cancer risk, others have reported a reduced risk associated with higher calcium intake. The long latency associated with the development of colorectal cancer and the duration of supplementation may contribute to the inconsistent findings. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dosage and duration of calcium supplementation for colorectal cancer prevention.",
        "Yes, calcium dietary supplementation can reduce the risk of colorectal cancer by providing a protective effect against tumors in the distal colon and rectal cancer. This inverse relationship between calcium consumption and colorectal cancer risk has been observed across various populations regardless of gender or source (dietary or supplemental). While initial trials showed no effect on incidence, ongoing follow-ups may provide further evidence for long-term benefits.",
        "Yes, calcium intake from dietary or supplemental sources appears to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, especially for tumors in the distal colon and rectum. However, one study found that daily supplementation of calcium with vitamin D for seven years did not affect colorectal cancer incidence in postmenopausal women, possibly due to the long latency period for colorectal cancer development.

However, this null finding may be due to the long latency associated with colorectal cancer development and the relatively short duration of the trial. , On a positive note, high calcium intake was found to have a greater protective effect against tumors of the distal colon and rectal cancer versus proximal colon. The risk reduction associated with calcium was similar for dietary and supplemental sources. Furthermore, calcium consumption was inversely related to colorectal cancer risk in a Korean population where national average calcium intake level is relatively lower than Western countries. A decreased risk of colorectal cancer by calcium intake was also observed in all sub",
        "The evidence on whether calcium supplementation can reduce the risk of colorectal cancer is mixed and inconclusive. Some observational studies suggest that higher calcium intake may be associated with a reduced colorectal cancer risk, especially for distal colon and rectal tumors. However, a large clinical trial found that daily supplementation of calcium with vitamin D for seven years had no effect on colorectal cancer incidence among postmenopausal women. The long latency period for colorectal cancer development and the trial\u0027s duration may have contributed to this null finding. While calcium consumption was inversely related to colorectal cancer risk in a Korean population study, more research is needed to clarify calcium supplementation\u0027s role in colorectal cancer prevention."

Many studies have confirmed the reduction of ACFs and colorectal adenomas after treatment with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) commonly referred to as ASA; however, the minimum effective dose of ASA and the duration of use has not been fully elucidated. The objective of our study was to assess the significance of low dose ASA (75-mg internally once daily) to study the chemopreventive effect of ASA in ACF and adenomas development in patients taking this drug for a minimum period of 10 years. Materials and Methods: Colonoscopy, combined with rectal mucosa staining with 0.25% methylene blue, was performed on 131 patients. The number of rectal ACF in the colon was divided into three groups: ACF \u003c 5; ACF 5−10; and ACF \u003e 10. Patients were divided into two groups: the “With ASA” group (the study group subjects taking ASA 75-mg daily for 10 years); and “Without ASA” group (control group subjects not taking ASA chronically). The incidence of different types of rectal ACF and colorectal polyps in both groups of subjects was analysed and ascertained. Results: Normal ACF was found in 12.3% in the study group vs. 87.7% control group, hyperplastic 22.4% vs. 77.6%, dysplastic 25% vs. 75%, mixed 0% vs. 100%.",

Uncertainty remains about the appropriate dose of aspirin for adenoma prevention. The persistence of the protective effect of NSAIDs against recurrent adenomas after treatment cessation is yet to be established.METHODS: Our objective was to update and systematically evaluate the evidence for aspirin and other NSAIDs on the incidence of recurrent colorectal adenomas taking into consideration the risks of random error and to appraise the quality of evidence using GRADE (The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Retrieved trials were evaluated using Cochrane risk of bias instrument. Meta-analytic estimates were calculated with random-effects model and random errors were evaluated with trial sequential analysis (TSA).RESULTS: In patients with a previous history of colorectal cancer or adenomas, low-dose aspirin (80-160 mg/day) compared to placebo taken for 2 to 4 years reduces the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas (relative risk (RR), 0.80 [95% CI (confidence interval), 0.70-0.92]). TSA indicated a firm evidence for this beneficial effect. The evidence indicated moderate GRADE quality. Low-dose aspirin also reduces the recurrence of advanced adenomas (RR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.44-0.99]); however, TSA indicated lack of firm evidence for a beneficial effect. High-dose aspirin (300-325 mg/day) did not statistically reduce the recurrent adenomas (RR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.68-1.18]). Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib 400 mg/day) were associated with a significant decrease in the recurrence of both adenomas (RR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.59-0.72]) and advanced adenomas (RR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.33-0.57]); however, this association did not persist and there was a trend of an increased risk of recurrent adenomas observed 2",

To evaluate the mechanism of aspirin and 5-aminosalicylic acid for suppressing the colon polyp growth, single and combined effects of 5-aminosalicylic acid and sodium salicylate (metabolite of aspirin) were tested in the two human colon cancer cells with different cyclooxygenase-2 expression levels and intestinal polyp-derived cells from familial adenomatous polyposis model mouse. The combination induced cell-cycle arrest at the G1 phase along with inhibition of cell growth and colony-forming ability in these cells. The combination reduced cyclin D1 via proteasomal degradation and activated retinoblastoma protein. The combination inhibited the colony-forming ability of mouse colonic mucosa cells by about 50% and the colony-forming ability of mouse intestinal polyp-derived cells by about 90%.

A two-sample MR analysis was performed using GWAS summary statistics of SA (INTERVAL and EPIC-Norfolk, N \u003d 14,149) and CRC (CCFR, CORECT, GECCO and UK Biobank, 55,168 cases and 65,160 controls).

The transition from normal mucosa to adenoma and its subsequent progression to carcinoma are protracted events that offer opportunities for preventive interventions. Suppression or reversal of the carcinogenic process in the colorectum with nonpharmacologic or pharmacologic agents, ie, chemoprevention, is an area of considerable research interest and activity. Interest in this field derives from multiple epidemiologic studies showing that regular and continued use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), predominantly aspirin, is associated with significant reductions in both colorectal adenoma and carcinoma incidence. NSAIDs were first shown to be effective in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Subsequent randomized trials in FAP demonstrated that sulindac and the selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, celecoxib, can significantly regress existing adenomas, and resulted in Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of celecoxib for adjunctive management of these patients.

We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether a combination of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), calcitriol, and calcium carbonate could prevent colorectal adenoma recurrence.METHODS: We included 1107 patients with 1 or more sporadic adenoma(s) removed from the colon or rectum at centers in Europe, Russia, or the United States, from 2004 through 2010. Inclusion criteria were 1 adenoma greater than 1 cm in diameter, more than 1 adenoma of any size, or an adenoma of any size and first-degree relatives with colorectal cancer. Subjects were assigned randomly to groups given 0.5 μg calcitriol, 75 mg acetylsalicylic acid, and 1250 mg calcium carbonate (n \u003d 209), or placebo (n \u003d 218), each day for 3 years. The primary outcome was adenoma recurrence assessed by colonoscopy after 3 years. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients with advanced adenomas, the total number of colorectal adenomas, and adenoma size and features.RESULTS: The trial was stopped in October 2010 because of futility. In this analysis, we found no differences between groups in the rate of recurrence (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-1.48), adverse effects, or secondary outcomes.

          "text": "There is evidence that aspirin--and apparently other NSAIDs--may be protective agents against cancer in the gastrointestinal tract. These effects are particularly well documented in the colon and rectum. Even considered in isolation, the observational data regarding colorectal neoplasia are quite strong, and the reality of a protective effect is buttressed by clinical trial data showing that aspirin prevents sporadic adenomas. Furthermore, the NSAIDs sulindac celecoxib have actually led to the regression of existing colorectal polyps in patients with FAP. Clearly, NSAIDs have the potential to suppress carcinogenesis in the large bowel. Observational data suggesting inverse associations of NSAIDs with cancers of the stomach and esophagus have emerged from several case-control studies and a few cohort analyses. In some studies the findings display features often associated with causal relationships, for example decreasing risks with increasing doses or duration of use. Nonetheless, the data currently do not support a secure conclusion that NSAIDs protect against these malignancies. The relevant data are not nearly as extensive as those for the colorectum, and case-control investigation of these upper gastrointestinal sites may be particularly delicate. It is conceivable that early symptoms of cancer (or of pre-invasive lesions) may have discouraged NSAID use in the cancer patients, creating the appearance of a protective association of the drugs with the risk of these malignancies. More extensive observational data particularly from cohort studies would be desirable to confirm the existing findings and clarify the doses and durations of use required for an effect. Clinical trial investigation might also be practical for pre-neoplastic endpoints, or--in carefully selected populations--perhaps with cancer as the focus. There are only relatively limited data available regarding the effect of NSAIDs on cancer of the pancreas. However, the studies that have investigated this malignancy have reported indications that NSAIDs may have a protective effect. The effects of NSAIDs on cancers outside the gastrointestinal tract are not clear. Some investigations suggest that NSAID use, particularly aspirin, is inversely associated with risk of cancers of the breast or ovary, but several well-done studies have not seen these associations, and the observations could have been due to bias or confounding. Findings regarding prostate cancer are similarly conflicting. The urinary tract is one organ system in which several studies have reported an increased cancer risk in association with NSAID use. Nonetheless, the effects remain unclear. There is only limited available information regarding carcinoma of the bladder, and no firm conclusions can be drawn at this point. More extensive data have been generated regarding the effect of NSAIDs--largely salicylates--on renal cell carcinoma or cancer or the renal pelvis and ureter. Although some studies have reported increased risks, there are also findings suggesting no association. It is particularly difficult for observational studies to ascertain with confidence the true effects of aspirin because of the suspected relationship of these cancers with use of phenacetin and perhaps acetaminophen. Further data--particularly from careful and large cohort studies--would be important to clarify these issues. As a body of research, the findings discussed here from epidemiological studies and clinical trials have begun to clarify the effect of NSAIDs on carcinogenesis in various organs in humans. There is clear potential for protective effects at several anatomic sites. Even for the colorectum, however, it is probably premature to now begin to use these drugs widely for cancer prevention. To reach that point, a weighing of the risks and benefits of the drugs needs to be made, together with a judgement regarding the benefits of alternative means of prevention.",

        "Yes, treatment with acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is indicated to help prevent colorectal adenomas in certain patients. Several randomized controlled trials have shown that regular aspirin use reduces the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas in patients with a previous history of these lesions. Meta-analyses suggest aspirin decreases recurrence of any adenoma by approximately 17-20% and advanced adenomas by 28% compared to placebo. The effect is seen with low-dose aspirin (80-160 mg/day) taken for at least 1-4 years. However, the benefits must be balanced against the risks of long-term aspirin use, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin is recommended for adenoma prevention in select higher-risk patients, such as those with a personal history of colorectal neoplasia, but is not currently advised for average-risk individuals. Screening colonoscopy with polyp removal remains the primary approach for preventing progression of adenomas to colorectal cancer.",
        "Yes, based on the findings of this randomized trial, treatment with acetyl salicylic acid (aspirin) is indicated for the prevention of colorectal adenomas in patients with previous colorectal cancer. The study found that daily use of aspirin was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of colorectal adenomas, the precursors to most colorectal cancers, compared to placebo (17% vs 27%, P\u003d0.004). The mean number of adenomas was also lower in the aspirin group, and the time to detection of a first adenoma was longer. These results suggest that aspirin use may decrease the risk of colorectal adenomas and potentially colorectal cancer in this high-risk population. However, it is important to consider the potential risks and benefits of long-term aspirin use on an individual basis, including gastrointestinal bleeding and other adverse",
        "The use of aspirin, also known as acetyl salicylic acid, has been associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of colorectal adenomas in patients with a history of colorectal cancer. This suggests that treatment with aspirin could be a potential preventative measure for colorectal adenomas. However, it is important to consider the potential risks and side effects of aspirin use, as well as the individual patient\u0027s medical history and overall health, before making a treatment recommendation. Further research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of aspirin use for the prevention of colorectal adenomas.",

        "No, daily use of aspirin is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of colorectal adenomas in patients with previous colorectal cancer.",
        "Yes, treatment with acetyl salicylic acid (aspirin) is indicated to prevent colorectal adenomas. Daily use of aspirin is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of colorectal adenomas in patients with previous colorectal cancer. Additionally, aspirin has been shown to have anti-tumoral effects, via inhibition of the PTTG1 gene, which is often overexpressed in tumors. Aspirin may also reduce the overall risk of both getting cancer and dying from cancer, with substantial evidence for lowering the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) when taken for at least 10–20 years. However, the benefits are greater than the risks due to bleeding in those at average risk, and some clinical perspectives of aspirin and anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment of colorectal adenomas remain uncertain.",

        "Yes, treatment with acetyl salicylic acid (aspirin) is indicated to prevent colorectal adenomas, particularly in patients with a history of previous colorectal cancer. Studies have consistently shown that daily aspirin use reduces the incidence of colorectal adenomas, which are precursors to colorectal cancer. This suggests that aspirin may play a role in chemoprevention of colorectal cancer. The evidence is strong enough to recommend aspirin therapy as an adjunct to standard care for patients with a history of colorectal cancer or adenomas, although the optimal dose and duration of treatment remain unclear.",

        "Based on the available evidence, daily aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) use may help prevent colorectal adenomas and colorectal cancer, but the benefits must be carefully weighed against the risks for each individual patient.\n\nThe provided study found that daily aspirin significantly reduced the incidence of colorectal adenomas in patients with previous colorectal cancer. However, the Wikipedia summary notes that aspirin likely needs to be taken for at least 10-20 years to reduce colorectal cancer risk, and more recent trial data has questioned the benefit of aspirin for primary cancer prevention.\n\nAdditionally, long-term aspirin use carries a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Current guidelines only recommend low-dose aspirin for colorectal cancer prevention in select patients aged 50-59 with elevated cardiovascular risk but low bleeding risk.\n\nTherefore, while aspirin may help prevent adenomas, it is not routinely indicated for all patients. The decision to use aspirin for this purpose should be made on a case-by-case basis considering the patient\u0027s baseline risk, expected benefit, potential complications, and personal preferences.
