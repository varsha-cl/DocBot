For left-sided mCRC with wild-type RAS, FOLFIRINOX plus bevacizumab is a promising option for patients with aggressive clinical presentations. The TRIBE study showed that FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in mCRC patients, regardless of RAS mutation status.

Therefore, it is essential to consider the patient\u0027s preferences and potential impact on quality of life when choosing a treatment regimen. For left-sided mCRC with wild-type RAS, FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab may be a preferred option due to its superior efficacy, but it is essential to weigh the benefits against the potential drawbacks and consider alternative options, such as FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab or FOLFOX plus panitumumab.

It is particularly effective at inhibitors of DNA separation and chromosome segregation, which can be important for treating left-sided RAS wild type advanced colorec0al cancer. ",
        "The study suggests that FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab is a valuable option for patients with left-sided RAS/BRAF wild-type mCRC, providing similar, if not better, outcomes compared to doublet chemotherapy plus anti-EGFRs. However, it is associated with a moderate increase in toxicity. Therefore, it may be adopted based on patients\u0027 preference and potential impact on quality of life. It is not specified if it is the preferred therapy for left-sided RAS wild type advanced colorectal cancer with aggressive clinical presentation.",
        "Based on the analysis from the trials mentioned (Valentino, TRIBE, TRIBE2, STEAM, and CHARTA), FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab is indeed a valuable option for left-sided RAS wild-type advanced colorectal cancer, especially in aggressive cases. It provides comparable, if not superior, survival outcomes to FOLFOX-panitumumab, with a moderate increase in toxicity. This makes it a strong alternative, particularly when considering patient preference and quality of life impacts",
        "no, FOLFIRINOX plus Bevacizumab is not the preferred therapy for left-sided RAS wild-type advanced colorectal cancer with aggressive clinical presentation. The preferred treatment remains doublet chemotherapy plus anti-EGFRs. However, FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab is a valuable option that can provide similar or potentially better outcomes, albeit with a moderate increase in toxicity. This treatment may be chosen based on patient preference and potential impacts on quality of life.",
        "As of my training data, the preferred therapy for left-sided RAS wild type advanced colorectal cancer with aggressive clinical presentation is FOLFOXIRI (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and folinic acid) plus bevacizumab (a monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor). This treatment regimen has shown superior progression-free survival and overall survival compared to FOLFOX (oxaliplatin and folinic acid) or XELOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) alone in clinical trials. However, the decision to use FOLFIRINOX plus Bevacizumab should be made on a case-by-case basis by a healthcare provider, taking into account the patient\u0027s individual characteristics and preferences, as well as potential side effects and toxicities associated with this treatment.",
        "* The study suggests that FOLFIRINOX plus Bevacizumab may be the preferred therapy for left-sided RAS wild type advanced colorectal cancer with aggressive clinical presentation.\n* However, this should be validated by further clinical trials.",
        "The text does not explicitly state that FOLFIRINOX plus Bevacizumab is the preferred therapy for left-sided RAS wild type advanced colorectal cancer with an aggressive clinical presentation. However, it does suggest that FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab could be a valuable option for patients with left-sided RAS/BRAF wild-type mCRC, providing similar or better outcomes compared to doublet chemotherapy plus anti-EGFRs, but at the cost of increased toxicity. The decision to adopt this treatment approach should consider patients\u0027 preferences and potential impact on quality of life. Further research may be needed to establish FOLFIRINOX plus Bevacizumab as the preferred therapy for specific subsets of colorectal cancer patients, such as those with aggressive clinical presentation.",
        "Based on the available evidence from randomized trials and propensity score-based analyses, FOLFOXIRI plus Bevacizumab is a viable treatment option for left-sided RAS wild type advanced colorectal cancer with aggressive clinical presentation. While doublet chemotherapy combined with anti-EGFRs remains the preferred first-line therapy due to its favorable safety profile and comparable efficacy, FOLFOXIRI plus Bevacizumab may offer improved survival outcomes at the cost of increased toxicity. The choice between these treatment options should be individualized, taking into account patient preferences, potential impact on quality of life, and a thorough risk-benefit assessment.",
        "Based on the current evidence, FOLFIRINOX plus Bevacizumab is not the preferred therapy for left-sided RAS wild type advanced colorectal cancer with aggressive clinical presentation. The preferred treatment in this scenario is doublet chemotherapy plus anti-EGFR agents. However, FOLFIRINOX plus Bevacizumab can be considered as a valuable option, although it may be associated with a moderate increase in toxicity. The choice of therapy should be based on patients\u0027 preference and potential impact on quality of life.",
        "No, FOLFIRINOX plus Bevacizumab is not the preferred therapy for left-sided RAS wild type advanced colorectal cancer with aggressive clinical presentation. The context provided only compares FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab with FOLFOX-panitumumab in five randomized trials, and a propensity score-based analysis was performed."

Here we analyzed plasma DNA from ten patients treated with anti-EGFR therapy by whole genome sequencing (plasma-Seq) and ultra-sensitive deep sequencing of genes associated with resistance to anti-EGFR treatment such as KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and EGFR.

However, pooled analysis of randomized controlled studies in Western countries in patients treated with cetuximab has suggested that patients with tumors showing the KRAS p.

We reasoned that KRAS amplification may also be responsible for primary resistance to these agents. Furthermore, while the prevalence of KRAS mutations has been well established in CRC, little is known about the frequency of KRAS amplification in large CRC series. We performed a screening of 1,039 CRC samples to assess the prevalence of KRAS amplification in this tumor type and further evaluated the role of this genetic alteration on the sensitivity to anti EGFR therapies. We detected KRAS amplification in 7/1,039 (0.67%) and 1/102 evaluable CRC specimens and cell lines, respectively. KRAS amplification was mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations. Tumors or cell lines harboring this genetic lesion are not responsive to anti-EGFR inhibitors.

Whereas extensive and combined deformities of the ventral chest wall are classically corrected using a so-called minimally invasive repair of the pectus excavatum, a modified Ravitch repair, or the minimized Erlangen repair, plastic surgeons are mostly challenged with alloplastic implant corrections of mild funnel chests. The authors have introduced an endoscopic method for placement of customized implants to restore the visible and nonfunctionally disturbing deformation of mild funnel chests when only the sternal plate is involved. This study compared these different plastic surgical and thoracic surgical approaches in a multicenter experience to develop a clinical algorithm and to identify those patients not requiring bony correction but rather alloplastic endoscopic implant correction alone.METHODS: Patients with deformed rib cages and sternal plates were treated with the Erlangen minimally invasive procedure or a modified Ravitch procedure. For deformities involving the sternal bones only, endoscopically assisted minimally invasive implantation of silastic implants was performed.RESULTS: Between 1987 and 2003, 599 patients with a pectus excavatum deformity were treated surgically by the authors\u0027 group. Between 1999 and 2003, 515 patients underwent surgery using the Erlangen minimally invasive repair technique at Friedrich-Alexander University-Erlangen. In addition, 84 patients underwent surgery at the Freiburg University Medical Center. In the current series, 79 patients underwent surgery using the modified Ravitch method. The mean patient age was 20.5 years (range, 3-54 years), and the rate of postoperative relapses was 5%. The findings showed that 73% of the patients judged the aesthetic result as excellent to good, and 20% were satisfied. In contrast, only five patients were suitable for soft tissue augmentation only. Two of these patients in the initial period received custom implants presternally via classical transverse skin incisions, whereas three patients were treated with endoscopic customized implant tissue augmentation.CONCLUSION: Whereas with combined deformity of the sternal plate and the rib cage, a modified Ravitch repair yields good results, the endoscopic soft tissue correction with customized implants helps to avoid unsightly scars, allows for safe hemostasis in the dissection pocket, and leads to enhanced patient satisfaction. In the case of major chest wall deformity with orthopedic and functional relevance, a combination of the minimally invasive procedures (e.g., endoscopic correction and Erlangen repair) seems to show both optimized cosmet",

To date, no studies directly evaluate the outcome of the new technique versus that of the conventional technique. From 2000 to 2002, 28 patients underwent pectus excavatum correction in the authors\u0027 hospital. Twenty-one were treated by minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum and seven patients had open correction. Intraoperative and postoperative complications, clinical outcome, and patient satisfaction were evaluated. In the minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum group, the children were younger (14.4 +/- 2.9 versus 17.8 +/- 3.2 years), had shorter operation times (53 +/- 18 versus 125 +/- 6 minutes), and had less blood loss (minimal versus 380 +/- 175 ml). No intraoperative complications were recorded. In the conventional group, two pleural lacerations occurred. Early postoperative complications in the minimally invasive repair group included two pneumothoraces and one case of pleural effusion. In the conventional group, one pneumothorax and one case of pleural effusion occurred. Late postoperative complications in the Nuss group included one costal erosion, two bar dislocations, one severe wound infection requiring bar removal, one hematothorax, and one case of postpericardiotomy syndrome; in the conventional group, there was one severe wound infection. In both groups, the patients rated their cosmetic results as good to very good. Minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum is a novel method with clear advantages, such as limited surgical trauma and small scars. The high rate of postoperative complications may decrease with growing experience in the future. In well-selected patients (age, symmetric deformity), the Nuss procedure may become the method of choice. However, there is still a lack of long-term follow-up.",

Ravitch\u0027s methods have been modified using autologous or exogenous materials to fix the lower sternum. Nuss reported a novel method in which neither an anterior wound nor the cutting of cartilage or sternum is required; instead, a convex metal bar is placed behind the sternum. We have reported sternocostal elevation, in which a section of costal cartilage is resected, and all of the cartilage stumps are resutured to the sternum. The secured ribs pull the sternum bilaterally, such that the resultant force causes the sternum to rise anteriorly.",

        "1. The Ravitch procedure, the classical procedure for pectus excavatum repair, was developed in 1949. It involves the resection of the affected costal cartilages and their substitution with a metal bar.\n2. The Nuss procedure, a less invasive and simpler procedure for pectus excavatum repair was developed in 1987.

        "The main methods for pectus excavatum repair are:\n\n1. Minimally invasive repair (Nuss procedure): This has become the standard operation. It involves placing a metal bar behind the sternum to push it outwards. Technical variations include morphology-tailored asymmetric bar shaping, approaching the retrosternal space through an additional subxiphoid incision, lifting the sternum during bar placement, or placing the bar extrapleurally.\n\n2. Open repair: This is a traditional surgical approach involving resection of deformed cartilages and fixation of the sternum in a corrected position. \n\nBoth the Nuss procedure and open repair can provide safe and effective correction of pectus excavatum when performed with technical expertise.",

Minimally Invasive Repair: This technique involves the use of a curved steel bar that is individually shaped for each patient and placed through an endoscopically created retrosternal tunnel between two bilateral midaxillary line incisions.\n\n2. Nuss Technique: This is a modification of the minimally invasive repair method, where a curved steel bar is used to reshape the chest wall and correct the deformity.\n\n3. Highly Modified Ravitch Repair: This is an open surgical technique that involves the removal of abnormal cartilage and ribs, followed by reshaping of the chest wall using sutures and/or prosthetic materials.\n\n4. Prolene Polypropylene Mesh Repair: This technique involves the use of a mesh made of polypropylene to provide support and stability to the chest wall.\n\n5. Compression Techniques: In some cases, compression techniques using a brace may be used to correct the deformity, particularly in cases of pectus carinatum.\n\nIt is important to note that the choice of repair method depends on the severity of the pectus excavatum, patient factors, and surgeon preference.",

We observed 69 febrile episodes in 33 patients (17 male, 16 female; 1.5-18.9 years, mean 7.31 years, median 5 years). Within this sample, there were 22 cases of positive blood cultures, 16 cases of sepsis, 38 cases of fever with no signs or symptoms of sepsis, and two deaths from infectious complications. All markers tested had good negative predictive value (73% - 93%). CRP was characterized by good specificity for registration bacteraemia (96%, 95% CI: 85% - 99%), but other results were inconclusive. We identified comparably balanced sensitivity (64% - 81%) and specificity (61% - 88%) for interleukin-6 and procalcitonin, and we proved their quality to predict positive blood culture and clinical signs of sepsis as well. Patients with gram-negative bacteraemia had significantly elevated levels of PCT and IL-6 in comparison with a group of patients with gram-positive bacteraemia (p \u003d 0.04 for PCT and p \u003d 0.005 for IL-6). Presepsin was characterized by poor specificity (27%, 95% CI: 15% - 43%) and positive predictive value (24%, 95% CI: 12 - 39%) for predicting bacteraemia, and by better sensitivity (84%, 95% CI: 55% - 98%) and specificity (58%, 95% CI: 42% - 73%) for predicting clinical signs of sepsis.",

Additionally, the chronic inflammation can lead to the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, such as CYLD, which can further contribute to the development of colorectal cancer. Furthermore, the chronic inflammation can also lead to the development of dysplasia and the progression of precancerous lesions to invasive cancer.

The relative risk of colorectal cancer is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, although there are geographical differences. In Crohn\u0027s disease, the relative risk of colorectal cancer is 2.5, and there is also an increased risk of small bowel cancer. Continuing colonic inflammation has been shown to be important in the development of colorectal cancer. Therefore, anti-inflammatory agents such as 5-aminosalicylates and immunomodulators have been considered as potential chemopreventive agents.",

        "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), particularly ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u0027s disease, are associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer due to chronic inflammation that can lead to DNA damage, altered cell growth regulation, and changes in the intestinal microbiome. The constant activation of inflammatory pathways in IBD patients may promote tumorigenesis through several mechanisms, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling, oxidative stress leading to 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u0027-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) formation, and epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation. The specific molecular changes associated with IBD that increase the risk of colorectal cancer are not fully understood but may involve alterations in tumor suppressor genes, oncogenes, and other key regulatory pathways.",

For example, studies have shown that people who experience poverty, unemployment, low education levels, poor housing conditions, and limited access to healthy food and safe living environments are more likely to develop chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mental health disorders. Additionally, social determinants can affect health outcomes indirectly by influencing health behaviors such as smoking, physical inactivity, and unhealthy eating habits. It is estimated that these factors can account for up to 40% of modifiable health risks. Addressing social determinants of health has the potential to improve health equity and reduce health disparities.",

Within this cohort, 193 children received corticosteroids during their septic episode and 284 did not.INTERVENTIONS: None.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Baseline summary characteristics demonstrated that children receiving or not receiving corticosteroids had similar demographics and disease severity as indicated by age, gender, mean Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores, and mean number of organ dysfunctions. Use of adjunctive corticosteroids increased during the F1K-MC-EVBP trial. Indications for corticosteroid prescription were therapeutic (89%, mostly shock) and prophylactic (13%).

The snippet suggests that prophylactic antiemetic therapy using 5HT3RA, DEX, and NK1RA may not be effective in controlling CINV induced by mFFX. Recent studies suggest that olanzapine may be effective in preventing CINV in patients receiving FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy.

However, it is important to note that CINV induced by FOLFIRINOX was poorly controlled even with this prophylactic antiemetic therapy, suggesting the need for enhanced antiemetic measures. Additionally, in patients with diabetes mellitus complications, sparing of steroids and glycemic control should be considered due to the risk of hyperglycemia.",
        "The optimal antiemetic treatment for FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy has not been fully established, but current guidelines recommend a combination of agents to prevent CINV. The most effective prophylactic regimen typically includes a serotonin receptor antagonist (5HT3RA) such as ondansetron or granisetron, dexamethasone (DEX), and sometimes a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist (NK1RA) like aprepitant. However, even with this combination therapy, some patients experience persistent nausea and vomiting, highlighting the need for more effective treatments to manage CINV induced by FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy.",

Enhanced antiemetic measures, such as additional medications or alternative regimens, may be necessary to improve CINV management for patients undergoing FOLFIRINOX therapy. However, the choice of antiemetic treatment should also consider potential side effects, such as hyperglycemia, and individual patient factors, including diabetes mellitus complications. Further research is needed to determine the most effective and safe antiemetic strategy for FOL",

The CINV persisted beyond 5 days.\n\nThe text does not provide information on the optimal antiemetic treatment for FOLFIRINOX.

It is recommended to use a 5HT3 receptor antagonist (5HT3RA), dexamethasone (DEX), and a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist (NK1RA) as prophylactic antiemetic therapy. However, in cases where CINV induced by FOLFIRINOX is poorly controlled even with this standard regimen, additional interventions may be required, such as the use of olanzapine or aprepitant.

In contrast, patients with RAS mutated or MSI-H tumors do not seem to benefit from the addition of EGFR inhibitors to their treatment regimen.

However, no validated predictors currently exist for its efficacy. Hypertension has been evaluated as a surrogate marker for efficacy of bevacizumab, although analyses, to date, have yielded conflicting results. The aim of this meta-analysis was to dissect the association between hypertension and efficacy of bevacizumab treatment in mCRC.METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM), and Wan Fang Digital Journals before September, 2013. The primary clinical outcomes included objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Relative risk (RR) or summary hazard ratio (HR) were calculated using a fixed-effects or random-effects model, depending on the heterogeneity of the included studies. Studies meeting our search criteria were assessed.RESULTS: Nine studies were considered eligible, with 1674 mCRC patients included. Six (308 patients, 104 with hypertension), 8 (1661 patients, 431 with hypertension) and 5 (1512 patients, 408 with hypertension) studies were eligible for the ORR, PFS and OS meta-analysis, respectively. Bevacizumab-related hypertension was associated with increased ORR (RR\u003d 1.63; 95% CI 1.26-2.12; p\u003d0.0002), improved PFS (HR\u003d0.68; 95% CI 0.58-0.79; p\u003c0.00001) and OS (HR\u003d0.52; 95% CI 0.42-0.66; p\u003c0.00001).

However, blood pressure measurement as a surrogate response biomarker has methodological limitations, and predictive biomarkers of angiogenesis inhibitors are lacking. In disease associated with hypertension, vasoactive peptides have been linked to cardiovascular pressure load. Here, we have explored potential associations between circulating levels of vasoactive peptides and tumor response during bevacizumab-containing treatment of colorectal cancer.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients with available best objective response (ORR) and time to tumor progression (TTP) data were included from a randomized clinical trial investigating maintenance therapy after first line chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. Midregional-pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM), midregional-pro-atrial-natriuretic-peptide (MR-proANP), and C-terminal-prepro-vasopressin (Copeptin) vasoactive peptide concentrations were measured in plasma at baseline and after 6 weeks of chemotherapy and bevacizumab treatment (n \u003d 97). We determined associations among clinical outcome (ORR and TTP), peptide levels, and hypertension (NCI-CTCAE 4.0 criteria), using Spearman\u0027s test, multiple linear regression, and Mann-Whitney\u0027s test.RESULTS: Increasing levels of vasoactive peptides from baseline and after six weeks of treatment were associated with improved treatment outcome (MR-proADM: ORR, p \u003d .0003; TTP, p \u003d .05; MR-proANP: ORR, p \u003d .05; TTP, p \u003d .03; Copeptin: ORR, p \u003d .10; TTP, p \u003d .02). Patients with increasing levels of all three peptides (n \u003d 28) versus increasing levels of one or two peptides (n \u003d 59) showed a median TTP of 284 and 225 d, respectively (p \u003d .02).CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that increasing systemic levels of vasoactive peptides associate with improved tumor response and TTP in mCRC patients treated with a bevacizumab-containing regimen. These findings support the proposed link between the tumor vasculature and the cardiovascular system of the host. This should motivate further studies that investigate the potential role of vasoactive peptides as a novel cl",

Response rates were 42% for patients with grades 0 to 1 HTN compared with 86% for patients with ≥grade 2 HTN (P\u003d0.043). Median overall survival was 21.6 months for patients with grades 0 to 1 HTN and 25.2 months for patients with ≥grade 2 HTN (P\u003d0.270). Twelve patients (24%) developed grade 1 PTN and 4 patients (8%) developed ≥grade 2 PTN. Median overall survival was 23.9 months for patients with grades 0 to 1 PTN and 4.2 months for those with ≥grade 2 PTN (P\u003d0.028).CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the utility of PTN as a surrogate marker of outcome in antiangiogenic therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. Although HTN is predictive of a significantly higher response rate, the development of PTN during treatment with bevacizumab or tyrosine kinase inhibitor portends poorer survi",

        "The epidemiology of breast cancer in men is similar to that of female breast cancer. However, male breast cancer accounts for less than 1% of all cancers in men and less than 1% of all breast cancers. Despite its rarity, the incidence of male breast cancer has been increasing over the past 25 years. The major risk factors for the development of male breast cancer include advancing age, hormonal imbalance, radiation exposure, and a family history of breast cancer. BRCA2 gene mutations are the most common genetic risk factor for male breast cancer. Male breast cancer is often diagnosed at a later stage than female breast cancer, with higher-grade tumors and lower estrogen receptor positivity. The incidence of lobular breast cancer is rare in men, but Paget\u0027s disease and papillary carcinoma occur more frequently in men than in women. Localized breast cancer is the most common stage at diagnosis for both men"

In the present study using rabbit antibodies raised against the cytoplasmic domain of rbet1, we found that the majority of rbet1 is not associated with the Golgi apparatus as marked by the Golgi mannosidase II in normal rat kidney cells. Rather, rbet1 is predominantly associated with vesicular spotty structures that concentrate in the peri-Golgi region but are also present throughout the cytoplasm. These structures colocalize with the KDEL receptor and ERGIC-53, which are known to be enriched in the intermediate compartment.",

        "The tumoral microbiome (TM) has been linked to cancer prognosis and is garnering progressively greater consideration as an essential facet of the tumor microenvironment that regulates tumor proliferation and affects cancer prognosis. The TM plays an important role in the formation of the tumor microenvironment, regulation of local immunity, and modification of tumor cell biology, and directly affects the efficacy of drug treatment for tumors. Recent studies have begun to highlight the diverse and tumor-specific microbiomes across multiple cancer types. New evidence suggests that microbes are also present in many tumors, though the scope of how they affect tumor biology and clinical outcomes is in its early stages. In cancer patients, the clinical response to checkpoint-based immunotherapy is associated with the composition and functional quality of the host microbiome. Our study suggests novel microbiome-specific/derived biomarkers for checkpoint immunotherapy response prediction and prognosis in lung cancer.",
        "The tumoral microbiome, which refers to the specific microorganisms residing in and around tumor tissues, plays a significant role in cancer development and progression. This is particularly relevant in obesity-associated malignancies such as colorectal, gastric, and liver cancers. Dysbiosis, or the imbalance of these gut microorganisms, can alter metabolite profiles and increase levels of carcinogenic toxins like Bacteroides fragilis toxin and colibactin, which contribute to oncogenesis—the process of tumor formation. Understanding the relationship between the gut microbiome and tumor development can help in creating targeted therapies and improving treatment responsiveness.",
        "The tumoral microbiome refers to the microorganisms and their secreted bioactive metabolites that are present within the tumor microenvironment. These microorganisms and their metabolites can contribute to the initiation and progression of cancer by modulating the immune response, promoting inflammation, and altering the metabolic profile of the tumor. Additionally, the tumoral microbiome can impact cancer treatment responsiveness by affecting drug metabolism and drug resistance. Therefore, understanding the tumoral microbiome is crucial for developing precision cancer therapeutics that target microorganisms or their secreted bioactive metabolites."

Participants had to routinely manage patients with mCRC. We present results from 629 participants who provided input on patient treatment scenarios (data cutoff: 17/01/2020). Prolonging overall survival (OS; 51%) was the main aim in first line. In third line, quality of life (QOL) was the primary goal (34%). Forty-three percent also cited efficacy-focused goals; 18% and 13% noted prolonging OS and improving progression-free survival as main aims, respectively. For fit and active patients, 89% of respondents considered trifluridine-tipiracil an appropriate third-line treatment; regorafenib (31%) or clinical trial enrollment (29%) were the fourth-line options. For patients with comorbidities and limited caregiver support, trifluridine-tipiracil was the preferred third-line treatment (70%). For KRAS-mutated patients with comorbidities and adverse events who received prior oxaliplatin, 90% considered oxaliplatin rechallenge an unsuitable third-line treatment, mainly due to the risk of cumulative toxicity (75%).

Eligible studies evaluated the efficacy, safety and patient-reported outcomes of monotherapies or combination therapies at any dose and number of treatment cycles for use beyond the second line in patients with mCRC. Studies were assessed for design and quality, and a qualitative data synthesis was conducted to understand the impact of treatment on overall survival and other relevant cancer-related outcomes.Results: The search yielded 938 references of which 68 were included for qualitative synthesis. There was limited evidence to support rechallenge with chemotherapy, targeted therapy or both. Compared with placebo, an overall survival benefit for trifluridine/tipiracil (also known as TAS-102) or regorafenib has been shown for patients previously treated with conventional chemotherapy and targeted therapy. There was no evidence to suggest a difference in efficacy between these treatments. Patient choice and quality of life at this stage of treatment should also be considered when choosing an appropriate therapy.Conclusions: These findings support the ",

        "The microbiota can modulate the effectiveness of immunotherapy by regulating the host immune system and tumor microenvironment. Certain bacteria can activate the immune system, enhancing the body\u0027s ability to fight tumors. These bacteria can stimulate the production of immune cells, such as T cells and natural killer cells, which can recognize and destroy cancer cells. On the other hand, some bacteria can mediate immunosuppression, helping cancer cells to evade the immune system. These bacteria can suppress the activity of immune cells, inhibit the production of cytokines, and promote the formation of immunosuppressive cells, such as regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. By modulating the balance between immune activation and immunosuppression, the microbiota can significantly affect the response to immunotherapy. For example, certain microbiota profiles have been associated with improved outcomes in patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy, while other profiles have been linked to resistance or toxicity. Therefore, understanding the role of the microbiota in modulating tumor immunity is crucial for optimizing the effectiveness of immunotherapy and improving patient outcomes.",
        "The gut microbiota modulates the effectiveness of immunotherapy through various mechanisms. It can affect the host immune system and tumor microenvironment, thereby influencing the response to cancer treatment. Some bacteria have been shown to activate immune responses, enhancing the anti-tumor effects of immunotherapy. Conversely, certain microbes can mediate immunosuppression, allowing cancer cells to evade the immune system and leading to poor therapeutic outcomes. , The composition of the gut microbiota has been linked to the efficacy and adverse reactions of tumor immunotherapy. Specific characteristics in the intestinal microbiota may serve as biomarkers for predicting treatment prognosis or even act as \"immune potentiators\" to assist immunotherapy. , Microbial interventions, such as transplantation and the use of engineered bacteria, have demonstrated potential in improving the sensitivity of immunotherapy and reducing side effects.

        "The microbiota can influence the effectiveness of immunotherapy primarily by interacting with the immune system. Certain bacteria in the gut can enhance the immune response, making the body more responsive to immunotherapy treatments. These bacteria do this by promoting the maturation and activation of immune cells like T cells, which are crucial for attacking cancer cells. Conversely, other bacteria might suppress immune responses, which can decrease the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Thus, the composition of the microbiota can play a significant role in how well immunotherapy works",
        "The microbiota modulates the effectiveness of immunotherapy through multiple mechanisms. Firstly, certain bacteria can activate the immune system and enhance the anti-tumor response. Secondly, the microbiota can influence the composition and function of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.

It is caused by reduced activity of proteins that synthesize diphthamide on human translation elongation factor 2. Diphthamide synthesis requires seven proteins (DPH1-DPH7), with clinical deficiency described for DPH1, DPH2 and DPH5. A limited set of variant alleles from syndromic patients has been functionally analyzed, but databases (gnomAD) list additional so far uncharacterized variants in human DPH1 and DPH2. Because DPH enzymes are conserved among eukaryotes, their functionality can be assessed in yeast and mammalian cells. Our experimental assessment of known and uncharacterized DPH1 and DPH2 missense alleles showed that six variants are tolerated despite inter-species conservation. Ten additional human DPH1 (G113R, A114T, H132P, H132R, S136R, C137F, L138P, Y152C, S221P, H240R) and two DPH2 (H105P, C341Y) variants showed reduced functionality and hence are deficiency-susceptibility alleles. Some variants locate close to the active enzyme center and may affect catalysis, while others may impact on enzyme activation.

The evolutionary conservation of the complex diphthamide biosynthesis pathway throughout eukaryotes implies a key role for diphthamide in normal cellular physiology. Of the proteins required for diphthamide synthesis, Dph3 is the smallest, containing only 82 residues. In addition to having a role in diphthamide biosynthesis, Dph3 is also involved in modulating the functions of the Elongator complex in yeast. To explore the physiological roles of Dph3 and to begin to investigate the function of diphthamide, we generated dph3 knockout mice and showed that dph3+/- mice are phenotypically normal, whereas dph3-/- mice, which lack the diphthamide modification on eEF-2, are embryonic lethal. Loss of both dph3 alleles causes a general delay in embryonic development accompanied by lack of allantois fusion to the chorion and increased degeneration and necrosis in neural tubes and is not compatible with life beyond embryonic day 11.5. The dph3-/- placentas also developed abnormally, showing a thinner labyrinth lacking embryonic erythrocytes and blood vessels. These results attest to the physiological importance of Dph3 in development. The biological roles of Dph3 are also discussed.",

Numerous barriers must be overcome to reach this goal because outcome is affected by an unholy trinity of tumor characteristics that include somatic alterations at the DNA, RNA, and protein level; patient characteristics that include germline genetic differences such as polymorphisms in enzymes affecting the metabolism of chemotherapeutic agents; and environmental exposures and factors that include diet and physical activity. At present, evaluation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression by immunohistochemistry in colorectal adenocarcinoma is generally required for treatment with one of the monoclonal antibody therapies directed against that target, despite the absence of evidence for predictive value of the assay, whereas EGFR fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) may be predictive. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration of the United States now requires a \u0027black box\u0027 warning on the packaging of irinotecan for evaluation of germline polymorphism in UGT1A1, the gene mutated in Gilbert\u0027s syndrome, for potential reduction of drug dosage in patients with the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism. Numerous other potential markers have been identified but have not yet reached levels of evidence that support their routine usage. For example, KRAS gene mutation appears to preclude improved survival after therapy with monoclonal antibody therapy directed at EGFR, and extensive DNA methylation is associated with lack of efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy. Additional markers will come into routine usage as reports of research studies continue to appear in the literature. Clinical",

This could lead to improved outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. However, the cost of genetic testing and the potential for false negatives or false positives must also be considered. Additionally, the clinical utility of UGT1A1 genotyping is still uncertain, and there is a lack of prospective studies examining the effectiveness of modifying irinotecan regimens based on UGT1A1 genotype. Therefore, it is unclear whether UGT1A1 alteration should be routinely determined in colorectal cancer patients. Further research is needed to determine the benefits and harms of UGT1",

Therefore, determining UGT1A1 status in colorectal cancer patients may help guide personalized treatment strategies and improve patient outcomes.",

However, the clinical significance of UGT1A1 testing in colorectal cancer patients receiving other chemotherapy agents, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), is less clear and requires further investigation. Therefore, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare provider or a genetic counselor to determine if UGT1A1 genotyping is appropriate for a specific patient\u0027s situation. In summary, UGT1A1 alteration should be routinely determined in colorectal cancer patients receiving irinotecan, but the decision to test for UGT1A1 alteration in patients receiving other chemotherapy agents is still a subject of debate among healthcare professionals.",

This can help to determine the optimal dose of irinotecan and prevent hematologic and digestive toxicities, especially in patients who are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele. However, it is important to note that testing for UGT1A1 alteration does not improve treatment efficacy, and its clinical utility remains uncertain due to the lack of prospective studies examining treatment options based on UGT1A1 genotype. Nevertheless, given the potential benefits and minimal harm associated with UGT1A1 testing, it is recommended as a routine practice in colorectal cancer patients receiving irinotecan-based therapy.",
        "Based on the current evidence, routine determination of UGT1A1 alteration in colorectal cancer patients is recommended. UGT1A1 polymorphisms, such as UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A1*6, have been associated with increased risk of irinotecan-induced toxicity, including severe hematological toxicity. Several studies have shown that patients with the UGT1A1*28 7/7 genotype have a higher risk of hematological toxicity, increased hospitalization rates, and lower overall survival when treated with irinotecan. Therefore, determining UGT1A1 alteration can help identify patients who may be at higher risk of adverse effects from irinotecan therapy and guide personalized treatment decisions.",
        "Yes, UGT1A1 alteration should be routinely determined in colorectal cancer patients. The presence of the UGT1A1*28 allele is associated with a higher risk of adverse effects and reduced efficacy of irinotecan-based therapy. Routine genotyping of UGT1A1 can help to identify patients who are at risk of adverse effects and optimize their treatment.",

        "Yes, routine determination of UGT1A1 alterations is recommended for colorectal cancer patients who are candidates for treatment with irinotecan-based chemotherapy. This is because genetic polymorphisms in the UGT1A1 gene can significantly affect a patient\u0027s ability to metabolize and tolerate irinotecan, leading to increased toxicity or reduced efficacy of the drug. The most common polymorphism, UGT1A1*28, has been associated with decreased glucuronidation activity and an increased risk of severe neutropenia when standard doses of irinotecan are used. Patients who are heterozygous for this allele or have other variants known to affect drug metabolism may benefit from dose reduction or alternative treatment strategies to optimize safety and efficacy.",
        "According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), no, UGT1A1 alteration should not be routinely determined in colorectal cancer patients. However, some healthcare providers and institutions may offer this testing on a case-by-case basis for patients with a history of severe toxicity or those receiving high-dose irinotecan. It is recommended to consult with a healthcare provider or a genetic counselor to determine if UGT1A1 genotyping is appropriate for a specific patient\u0027s situation.",

This suggests that testing for these specific alleles could be sufficient for risk stratification and personalized treatment planning. However, it is important to note that this conclusion is based on the examination of certain UGT1A loci only and may not exclude the potential relevance of other UGT1A alterations. Therefore, further research is needed to comprehensively evaluate the clinical utility of UGT1A1 genotyping in colorectal cancer management.",

However, the study also found that examining more UGT1A loci did not improve the predictive value of irinotecan-based toxicity and efficacy. Therefore, it is unclear whether UGT1A1 alteration should be routinely determined in colorectal cancer patients. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the clinical utility of UGT1A1 genotyping in this patient population.",

Therefore, routine determination of UGT1A1 alterations may not be necessary for all colorectal cancer patients receiving irinotecan treatment. However, it is important to note that this conclusion is based on the specific studies mentioned and does not rule out the potential value of genetic testing in certain clinical contexts or patient populations. For personalized medicine approaches, further research is needed to determine if other genetic markers or combinations thereof could provide more accurate predictions of irinotecan response and toxicity.",

Therefore, routine determination of UGT1A1 alterations beyond *6 and *28 does not appear to be beneficial for guiding irinotecan therapy in this patient population. The abstract suggests focusing on UGT1A1*6 and *28 variants is sufficient. However, more context and additional studies would be needed to make a definitive recommendation on routine UGT1A1 testing in colorectal cancer.",

Although additional UGT1A loci beyond UGT1A1*6 and UGT1A1*28 do not improve the predictive value of irinotecan-based toxicity and efficacy, UGT1A1 alterations can still have clinical implications. UGT1A1 polymorphisms are associated with variable drug metabolism and can affect the response to irinotecan, a commonly used chemotherapy drug in colorectal cancer. Therefore, determining UGT1A1 alterations can help guide treatment decisions and optimize patient outcomes."

        "Surgical resection is not necessarily the most appropriate treatment for MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer patients. Immunotherapy, specifically neoadjuvant therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has shown promising results in treating MSI-H/dMMR rectal cancer. ICIs are more active in treatment-naïve patients than in patients with refractory MSI-H/dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer, and they have been shown to be effective in achieving complete clinical and pathological responses in locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR rectal cancer patients. Additionally, neoadjuvant treatment with ICIs has the potential to preserve organ function and fertility in young patients. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider neoadjuvant immunotherapy as a viable alternative to surgical resection for MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer patients. However, clinical trials are",
        "No, surgical resection is not an appropriate treatment over immunotherapy in MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer patients.",
        "In MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer patients, neoadjuvant immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, has shown promising results in terms of efficacy and safety. Surgical resection following neoadjuvant immunotherapy may be considered as a treatment strategy, especially when there is a good response to immunotherapy leading to tumor downsizing or achieving a pathological complete response (pCR). The decision between surgical resection and immunotherapy should be individualized based on factors such as tumor response to immunotherapy, patient\u0027s overall health status, and treatment goals. Further studies and clinical trials are ongoing to determine the optimal treatment approach for MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer patients.",
        "No, neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade had high efficacy and led to a high rate of CR in LARC patients with dMMR/MSI-H.",
        "While surgical resection is a good treatment option for MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer patients, immunotherapy is preferred because the latter has been proven to provide more benefits to patients in the long term",
        "No, surgical resection may not be the most appropriate treatment for MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients. Recent studies suggest that neoadjuvant immunotherapy (NAICI) treatment, such as monoimmunotherapy with PD-1 inhibitor, can have favorable overall response rate (ORR) and pathological complete response (pCR) rate, as well as relatively low incidences of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and serious adverse events (srAEs) for patients with dMMR/MSI-H LARC. Additionally, a case report showed that a patient with LARC and MSI-H achieved pCR and complete radical resection after being treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (TNT) with nivolumab. The NICHE trial also pioneered the use of NAICI treatment in LARC, and recent reports from several phase II studies have demonstrated satisfactory tumor downsizing in CRC. However, further studies are needed to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of immunotherapy in MSI-H LARC patients.",
        "No. Due to the special features of biologics in MSI-H/dMMR CRC patients, this subgroup of patients achieved little treatment efficacy from chemoradiotherapy but benefited from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).",
        "No, surgical resection is not an appropriate treatment over immunotherapy in MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer patients because the latter one showed better outcome in recent studies.",
        "No, immunotherapy has shown high efficacy in MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer patients.",
        "Surgical resection is currently the standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer, including those that are MSI-H. However, recent studies have shown that neoadjuvant treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can be highly effective in MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer patients, resulting in a complete clinical and pathological response. While these results are promising, it is important to note that they come from case reports and small studies, and further research is needed to establish the role of ICIs in the treatment of MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer. Additionally, organ-preservation strategies should be evaluated in clinical trials. Therefore, while surgical resection remains the standard of care, immunotherapy may be a promising alternative for MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer patients.",
        "The use of surgical resection as a treatment for MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer patients should be considered in conjunction with immunotherapy. While immunotherapy has shown promising results in achieving complete clinical and pathological responses, surgical resection remains an important component of treatment to ensure complete removal of the tumor and assess the extent of disease. The combination of neoadjuvant immunotherapy followed by surgical resection may offer the best outcomes for these patients, allowing for organ preservation and potentially avoiding the need for chemoradiation therapy in the future.",
        "No. Surgical resection is not an appropriate treatment over immunotherapy in locally advanced MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer patients.",
        "In conclusion, while surgery remains the standard of care for localized rectal cancers, emerging data suggests that neoadjuvant immunotherapy may be a safe and effective treatment option for select patients with mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high tumors. For these individuals, particularly those who achieve clinical complete response to immunotherapy, close surveillance without immediate surgical intervention could potentially offer a less invasive approach with comparable outcomes. However, larger studies are needed to fully understand the long-term benefits and risks of this strategy.",
        "No, immunotherapy is a more appropriate treatment for MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer patients.",
        "No, surgical resection is not necessarily an appropriate treatment over immunotherapy in MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer patients. While surgical resection remains the standard of care due to the high likelihood of achieving a pathologic complete response (pCR) with neoadjuvant therapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown promising results in this population, particularly in metastatic disease. In fact, ongoing clinical trials are investigating the role of ICIs in combination with neoadjuvant therapy in MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer patients to determine if they can improve outcomes beyond surgery alone. Therefore, the decision to choose between surgical resection and immunotherapy in MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer patients should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account factors such as tumor stage, patient preferences, and the availability of clinical trials.",
        "No, surgical resection alone is not the most appropriate treatment for MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients. The evidence suggests that these patients benefit more from neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) compared to standard chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery.\n\nKey points:\n- MSI-H/dMMR LARC patients achieve little benefit from standard chemoradiotherapy but respond well to ICIs\n- Neoadjuvant ICI treatment before surgery leads to better systemic immune function, increased antigenic exposure, and improved long-term memory induction\n- Several phase II studies have shown that neoadjuvant ICI results in satisfactory tumor downsizing in MSI-H LARC\n- Neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy has favorable response rates, pathologic complete response rates, and acceptable safety in MSI-H LARC\n\nTherefore, while surgery remains an important component of treatment, the evidence supports using neoadjuvant immunotherapy first in MSI-H LARC patients, rather than upfront surgical resection alone. The combination of neoadjuvant ICIs followed by surgery appears to be the preferred approach for improved outcomes in this molecular subset of rectal cancer.",

However, in patients with dMMR/MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer who achieve a complete pathological response (cCR) during neoadjuvant immunotherapy, adopting immunotherapy as a curative-intent treatment might be considered as an alternative option.

        "In the case of patients with MSI-H/dMMR locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), surgical resection might still be considered a primary treatment option. This is because these patients typically receive little benefit from neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCT), which are common pre-surgical treatments aimed at reducing tumor size and spread. Since MSI-H/dMMR tumors have a unique genetic profile that makes them less responsive to these therapies, focusing on surgical options could be more beneficial. However, exploring immunotherapy as a part of the treatment strategy is also advisable, given its potential effectiveness in targeting the specific genetic abnormalities present in MSI-H/dMMR cancers.",

Since the effectiveness of these therapies is limited in MSI-H/dMMR patients, moving directly to surgical resection could be a more effective strategy.

A retrospective single-center study suggested that the use of bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy in this patient population can result in high disease control rates. However, the selection of patients may have influenced the results, and further research is necessary to confirm these findings. In contrast, clinical data and in vitro studies suggest that a previous anti-VEGF therapy may decrease the efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer. Therefore, it is uncertain whether bevacizumab is indicated after progression to a previous regimen with bevacizumab in advanced colorectal cancer patients, and further research is needed to determine its efficacy in this setting.",
        "Yes, the results of this study suggest that re-introduction of bevacizumab may still result in clinically meaningful benefits in some patients with advanced colorectal cancer.",
        "The use of Bevacizumab after progression on a previous regimen with Bevacizumab may still be indicated in advanced colorectal cancer patients, as it has shown benefits in combination with other agents or regimens in late-line or salvage therapy, potentially improving patient outcomes and survival rates. However, the decision to continue Bevacizumab therapy after progression should be carefully evaluated based on individual patient factors, treatment history, and response to prior therapies.",
        "The use of Bevacizumab after progression to a previous regimen with Bevacizumab in advanced colorectal cancer patients is not indicated. According to the document, adding bevacizumab to second-line regimen after failing a bevacizumab-containing regimen does not indicate any benefit. Instead, it suggests that patients may develop addiction to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents in these cases.",
        "According to the guidelines by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the use of Bevacizumab after progression to a previous regimen with Bevacizumab is not recommended in advanced colorectal cancer patients. However, in some clinical trials, Bevacizumab has shown activity in patients who have previously received Bevacizumab, and its use in this setting is being investigated in ongoing clinical trials. Therefore, the decision to continue Bevacizumab in this setting should be made on an individual basis, taking into account the patient\u0027s overall clinical condition and the potential risks and benefits of continued treatment. In summary, the answer is both yes and no, depending on the specific context and recommendations from a healthcare provider.",
        "No, the use of Bevacizumab is not indicated after progression to a previous regimen with Bevacizumab in advanced colorectal cancer patients. The study mentioned in the context evaluated the efficacy and adverse events of Bevacizumab in colorectal cancer patients. It showed that the median time to progression (TTP) was not significantly different between combination therapy with mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI. However, the TTP of Bevacizumab first-line treatment was significantly longer than that of second-line treatment. Therefore, Bevacizumab is recommended for first-line therapy of advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, but its use after progression to a previous regimen with Bevacizumab is not supported by the available evidence.",
        "The question posed is whether the use of bevacizumab is indicated after progression to a previous regimen containing bevacizumab in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. While there are limited data on this specific scenario, clinical practice and expert opinions suggest that for some patients with metastatic CRC who have progressed on a prior bevacizumab-containing regimen, reintroduction of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy may still provide benefit. This is based on the premise that despite initial progression, these patients may respond differently to subsequent treatments due to factors such as tumor heterogeneity and the potential for different mechanisms of resistance. However, decisions regarding retreatment should take into account individual patient characteristics, including disease status, response to previous therapy, overall health, and treatment goals. It is important to note that further research is needed to better understand the role of bevacizumab in this context and to establish clear guidelines for its use after progression on a prior",
        "The use of bevacizumab after progression to a previous regimen with bevacizumab in advanced colorectal cancer patients is not clearly established. While some studies suggest that continuing bevacizumab therapy can improve survival outcomes in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have progressed on previous treatment, other studies have found inconclusive results regarding the efficacy of bevacizumab in this setting. Additionally, the safety profile of continued bevacizumab use has been shown to be manageable but requires careful monitoring for potential side effects. Ultimately, the decision to use bevacizumab after progression to a previous regimen should be individualized and take into account factors such as patient performance status, tumor burden, and other relevant clinical variables. It is important to consult with a qualified healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment for each patient.",
        "Yes, based on the results of the BOND-2 study, the use of Bevacizumab is indicated after progression to a previous regimen with Bevacizumab in advanced colorectal cancer patients who have received at least 6 months of prior Bevacizumab-containing therapy. However, the decision to continue Bevacizumab in this setting should still be made on an individual basis, taking into account the patient\u0027s overall clinical condition and the potential risks and benefits of continued treatment. It is always recommended to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized treatment recommendations.",
        "Yes, the use of bevacizumab is indicated after progression on a previous bevacizumab-containing regimen in advanced colorectal cancer patients. Studies have shown that continuing anti-VEGF therapy with bevacizumab in second-line treatment, even after progression on a bevacizumab-containing first-line regimen, can provide survival benefits. Bevacizumab may be added to first, second, and third-line chemotherapy for palliative treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, with data indicating increased patient survival, good response rates, and low toxicity. The benefit of maintaining bevacizumab or switching to other anti-VEGF agents like aflibercept after first-line progression suggests an ongoing dependence on VEGF inhibition in these patients.",
        "The use of bevacizumab after progression to a previous regimen with bevacizumab is not indicated in advanced colorectal cancer patients. Bevacizumab has shown efficacy as a first-line treatment in combination with chemotherapy, but its benefit as a second-line therapy after progression is limited. Alternative treatment options should be considered in patients who have progressed on bevacizumab-based regimens.",
        "Yes, the use of Bevacizumab after progression in advanced colorectal cancer patients is indicated. The study suggests that continuing vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition with Bevacizumab beyond initial progression of the disease (PD) could significantly improve the overall success of the therapy for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).",
        "Yes, the use of bevacisubab is often indicated after progression to a previous regimen with bevacisubab in advanced coloreectal cancer (CRC) patients. This is because bevacisubab, being a monoclonal antibody, can specifically recognize and bind to human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFP) on the surface of cancer cells. This recognition and binding can lead to the activation of the complement system, resulting in the selective destruction of cancer cells. ",

Patients should discuss the potential benefits and risks with their healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment plan for their individual situation.",
        "Yes, the use of Bevacizumab is indicated after progression to a previous regimen with Bevacizumab in advanced colorectal cancer patients. A large observational study (BRiTE) showed that continuing Bevacizumab treatment beyond initial disease progression (BBP) was strongly and independently associated with improved survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The study reported a longer-than-expected overall survival of 25.1 months in patients who received Bevacizumab. The results suggest that continued vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition with Bevacizumab could play an important role in improving the overall success of therapy for patients with mCRC.",

        "Yes, the use of Bevacizumab beyond first progression (BBP) is indicated in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The BRiTE study, a large observational cohort study, demonstrated that BBP was strongly and independently associated with improved overall survival (OS) in metastatic CRC patients who had previously been untreated and experienced disease progression. Median OS rates were 12.6, 19.9, and 31.8 months in the no post-PD treatment, no-BBP, and BBP groups, respectively. Multivariate analyses further confirmed these findings, indicating that BBP significantly improved survival compared to no BBP (HR, 0.48; P \u003c .001). Hypertension requiring medication was the only bevacizumab-related safety event observed more frequently in the BBP group. Therefore, continued vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition with Bevacizum",

About 9% of patients suffer from serious, sometimes even life-threatening adverse effects of a 5-FU therapy, such as haemotoxicity, which cannot be reliably predicted by conventional clinical and pharmacokinetic criteria. The systemic exposure to 5-FU is fundamentally determined by the genetically polymorphic enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). This deficiency is closely related to 5-FU-induced toxicity and a variety of non-synonymous variants has been detected in affected patients. The exon14-skipping mutation is the gene defect most frequently associated with serious 5-FU-related adverse effects and it has been reported ten times more often in affected individuals than in the general population. The 2846A\u003eT polymorphism, which leads to an amino acid substitution, appears to be of comparable importance. While the causative role of premature stop codons - presumably resulting from spontaneous mutations - is very likely, the pathophysiological relevance of various other amino acid changes is still unclear. Patients who harbour a high-risk genotype should not be treated with 5-FU if therapeutic alternatives are available. The present data indicate that complete genotyping of the encoding DPYD gene is desirable, in the interest of drug safety, before treatment is started, although only a small number of patients would actually benefit. A method for the quantification of the DPD activity in vivo would have the advantage of reflecting all genetic and non-genetic influences.\u0027 However, no such method is currently available for routine use.

        "Yes, PDYD (dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase) polymorphism determination should be routinely performed in colorectal cancer patients treated with fluoropyrimidines. The abstract describes a prospective study that demonstrated reduced severe toxicity in patients who received genotype-guided dosing of fluoropyrimidines based on PDYD variants. Specifically, DPYD*2A and c.1679T\u003eG carriers benefited from a 50% initial dose reduction, while c.1236G\u003eA and c.2846A\u003eT carriers may require a larger dose reduction of 50%. Given that fluoropyrimidines are commonly used anticancer agents, the implementation of PDYD genotype-guided individualized dosing should be considered a new standard of care to improve patient safety and treatment outcomes.",
        "Yes, DPYD polymorphism determination should be considered for routine performance in patients with colorectal cancer who are candidates for fluoropyrimidine treatment such as 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine. This is because genetic variants in the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) gene have been associated with an increased risk of severe and potentially life-threatening toxicity, particularly when patients carry certain DPYD alleles that result in reduced enzyme activity. By identifying these polymorphisms before initiating treatment, clinicians can adjust the fluoropyrimidine dose to reduce the likelihood of severe toxic effects, thereby improving patient safety and outcomes.",
        "Yes, prospective DPYD genotyping was feasible in routine clinical practice, and DPYD genotype-based dose reductions improved patient safety of fluoropyrimidine treatment.",
        "Yes, prospective DPYD genotyping should be routinely performed in colorectal cancer patients treated with fluoropyrimidines (FP). DPYD genetic variants are associated with extremely severe, early-onset FP toxicity. Prospective DPYD genotyping is feasible in routine clinical practice, and DPYD genotype-based FP dose reductions improve patient safety.",
        "Yes, determining DPYD polymorphism should be routinely performed in colorectal cancer patients to improve patient safety by allowing for dose adjustments of fluoropyrimidine treatment based on genetic predisposition to toxicity.",
        "Yes, DPYD polymorphism determination should be routinely performed in patients with colorectal cancer. Host genetic variants in the DPYD gene have been found to be associated with severe toxicity in patients treated with fluoropyrimidine drugs. Prospective DPYD genotyping has been shown to be feasible in routine clinical practice and has led to improved patient safety by allowing for genotype-based dose reductions. Therefore, routine DPYD polymorphism determination can help identify patients who are at higher risk of toxicity and guide personalized treatment strategies.",
        "Yes, PDYD polymorphism determination should be routinely performed in patients with colorectal cancer patients to identify those who may be at risk for severe toxicity from fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy."

However, colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogenic disease and associations with the molecular pathological pathways are unclear.METHODS: This population-based case-control study includes 2444 cases with first-diagnosis CRC and 2475 controls. Tumour tissue was analysed for MSI (microsatellite instability), CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype), BRAF (B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase gene) and KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue gene) mutations. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated for associations between alcohol and smoking and CRC molecular subtypes and pathways.RESULTS: Current smoking showed higher ORs for MSI-high (OR \u003d 2.79, 95% CI: 1.86-4.18) compared to MSS (OR \u003d 1.41, 1.14-1.75, p-heterogeneity (p-het) \u003d 0.001), BRAF-mutated (mut) (OR \u003d 2.40, 1.41-4.07) compared to BRAF-wild type (wt) (OR \u003d 1.52, 1.24-1.88, p-het \u003d 0.074), KRAS-wt (OR \u003d 1.70, 1.36-2.13) compared to KRAS-mut (OR \u003d 1.26, 0.95-1.68, p-het \u003d 0.039) and CIMP-high (OR \u003d 2.01, 1.40-2.88) compared to CIMP-low/negative CRC (OR \u003d 1.50, 1.22-1.85, p-het\u003d0.101). Current smoking seemed more strongly associated with sessile serrated pathway (CIMP-high + BRAF-mut; OR \u003d 2.39, 1.27-4.52) than with traditional pathway CRC (MSS + CIMP-low/negative + BRAF-wt; OR \u003d 1.50, 1.16-1.94) and no association was observed with alternate pathway CRC (MSS + CIMP-low/negative + KRA",

We used inverse probability weighted duplication-method Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate differential associations across subtypes.Results: We documented 1175 CRC patients with molecular subtype data: subtype 1 (n \u003d 498; conventional pathway; non-MSI-high, CIMP-low or negative, BRAF-wild-type, KRAS-wild-type), subtype 2 (n \u003d 138; serrated pathway; any MSI status, CIMP-high, BRAF-mutated, KRAS-wild-type), subtype 3 (n \u003d 367; alternate pathway; non-MSI-high, CIMP-low or negative, BRAF-wild-type, KRAS-mutated), and subtype 4 (n \u003d 172; other marker combinations).

Three carcinogenic pathways determine its molecular profile: microsatellite instability (MSI), chromosomal instability (CIN) and CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). Based on the new molecular classification, four consensus CRC molecular subtypes (CMS) are established, which are related to clinical, pathological and biological characteristics of the tumor.AIM: To classify Chilean patients with sporadic CRC according to the new consensus molecular subtypes of carcinogenic pathways.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective analytical study of 53 patients with a mean age of 70 years (55% males) with CRC, operated at a private clinic, without neoadjuvant treatment. From normal and tumor tissue DNA of each patient, CIN, MSI and CIMP were analyzed. Combining these variables, tumors were classified as CMS1/MSI-immune, CMS2/canonical, CMS3/metabolic and CMS4/mesenchymal.RESULTS: CMS1 tumors (19%) were located in the right colon, were in early stages, had MMR complex deficiencies and 67% had an activating mutation of the BRAF oncogene. CMS2 tumors (31%) were located in the left colon, had moderate differentiation, absence of vascular invasion, lymphatic and mucin.

          "text": "BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is an established risk factor for colorectal cancer. Because colorectal carcinogenesis is a heterogeneous process, we investigated whether cigarette smoking is differentially associated with molecularly defined subtypes of colorectal cancer.METHODS: We evaluated associations between smoking and incident colorectal cancer, overall and by microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype (MSI-high vs MSI-low or microsatellite stable), CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP positive or CIMP negative), and BRAF mutation status (BRAF mutation positive or BRAF mutation negative), among 37 399 participants in a population-based cohort study (the Iowa Women\u0027s Health Study). Cigarette smoking (and other exposures) was assessed by self-report at baseline in 1986, including smoking status (never and ever [former or current]), age at initiation, total duration, average number of cigarettes smoked per day, cumulative pack-years, and induction period. Vital status and state of residence were determined by mailed follow-up questionnaires in 1987, 1989, 1992, and 1997 and by linkage to Iowa death certificate records. Nonrespondents were checked via the National Death Index to identify descendants. Participants with newly diagnosed (ie, incident) colorectal cancer were identified through annual linkage with the Iowa Cancer Registry. Archived paraffin-embedded tumor tissue specimens were obtained for 555 patients with colorectal cancer who were diagnosed from January 1, 1986, through December 31, 2002, and MSI status, CIMP status, and BRAF status were determined. Multivariable Cox regression models were fit to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).RESULTS: Ever-smokers were at moderately increased risk for incident colorectal cancer (RR \u003d 1.19, 95% CI \u003d 1.05 to 1.35) compared with never-smokers. Higher risk estimates were observed for current smokers with MSI-high tumors (RR \u003d 1.99, 95% CI \u003d 1.26 to 3.14), CIMP-positive tumors (RR \u003d 1.88, 95% CI \u003d 1.22 to 2.90), and BRAF mutation-positive tumors (RR \u003d 1.92, 95% CI \u003d 1.22 to 3.02). Other smoking-related variables (ie, age at initiation, total duration, average number of cigarettes smoked per day, cumulative pack-years, and induction period) were also associated with MSI-high, CIMP-positive, and BRAF mutation-positive tumor subtypes. Conversely, cigarette smoking status (ever vs never) was not associated with the MSI-low or microsatellite stable (RR \u003d 1.00, 95% CI \u003d 0.79 to 1.25), CIMP-negative (RR \u003d 1.02, 95% CI \u003d 0.81 to 1.30), or BRAF mutation-negative subtypes (RR \u003d 1.00, 95% CI \u003d 0.65 to 1.27).CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study of older women, cigarette smoking was associated with the MSI-high, CIMP-positive, and BRAF mutation-positive colorectal cancer subtypes, which indicates that epigenetic modification may be functionally involved in sm",

However, autophagy is commonly altered and compromised in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. Parkinson\u0027s disease (PD) can be considered a multifactorial disease because environmental factors, genetic factors, and aging are involved. Several genes are involved in PD pathology, among which the LRRK2 gene and its mutations, inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, are responsible for most genetic PD cases. The R1441G LRRK2 mutation is, after G2019S, the most important in PD pathogenesis. Our results demonstrate a relationship between the R1441G LRRK2 mutation and a mechanistic dysregulation of autophagy that compromises cell viability. This altered autophagy mechanism is associated with organellar stress including mitochondrial (which induces mitophagy) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, consistent with the fact that patients with this mutation are more vulnerable to toxins related to PD, such as MPP",

Because this neurotoxicity involves ROS production, we investigated the efficacy of mangafodipir, a molecule that has antioxidant properties and is approved for use as an MRI contrast enhancer.METHODS: The effects of mangafodipir were examined in mice following treatment with oxaliplatin. Neurotoxicity, axon myelination, and advanced oxidized protein products (AOPPs) were monitored. In addition, we enrolled 23 cancer patients with grade ≥ 2 oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy in a phase II study, with 22 patients receiving i.v. mangafodipir following oxaliplatin. Neuropathic effects were monitored for up to 8 cycles of oxaliplatin and mangafodipir.RESULTS: Mangafodipir prevented motor and sensory dysfunction and demyelinating lesion formation. In mice, serum AOPPs decreased after 4 weeks of mangafodipir treatment. In 77% of patients treated with oxaliplatin and mangafodipir, neuropathy improved or stabilized after 4 cycles. After 8 cycles, neurotoxicity was downgraded to grade ≥ 2 in 6 of 7 patients. Prior to enrollment, patients received an average of 880 ± 239 mg/m2 oxaliplatin. Patients treated with mangafodipir tolerated an additional dose of 458 ± 207 mg/m2 oxaliplatin despite preexisting neuropathy. Mangafodipir responders managed a cumulative dose of 1,426 ± 204 mg/m2 oxaliplatin. Serum AOPPs were lower in responders compared with those in nonresponders.CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that mangafodipir can prevent and/or relieve oxalip",

GLP-1 receptor agonists have been reported to exhibit neuroprotective effects on the central and peripheral nervous systems. In this study, we investigated the effects of exenatide on oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy in rats and cultured cells.METHODS: Oxaliplatin (4 mg/kg) was administered intravenously twice per week for 4 weeks, and mechanical allodynia was evaluated using the von Frey test in rats.

N-Palmitoylethanolamine (PEA) modulates glial cells and exerts antinociceptive effects in several animal models. In order to improve the therapeutic chances for chemotherapy-dependent neuropathy management, the role of PEA was investigated in a rat model of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy (2.4 mg kg-1 daily, intraperitoneally). On day 21, a single administration of PEA (30 mg kg-1 i.p.) was able to reduce oxaliplatin-dependent pain induced by mechanical and thermal stimuli. The repeated treatment with PEA (30 mg kg-1 daily i.p. for 21 days, from the first oxaliplatin injection) prevented lowering of pain threshold as well as increased pain on suprathreshold stimulation. Ex vivo histological and molecular analysis of dorsal root ganglia, peripheral nerves and spinal cord highlighted neuroprotective effects and glia-activation prevention induced by PEA repeated administration. The protective effect of PEA resulted in the normalization of the electrophysiological activity of the spinal nociceptive neurons. Finally, PEA did not alter the oxaliplatin-induced mortality of the human colon cancer cell line HT-29. The efficacy of PEA in neuropathic pain control and in preventing nervous tissue alteration candidates this endogenous compound as disease modifying agent. These characteristics, joined to the safety profile, suggest the usefulness of PEA in chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. ",

        "Duloxetine, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is the best-established treatment for painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).  Despite intense investigation at the preclinical and clinical levels, no treatment can be suggested for the prevention of Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (OIPN), and only limited evidence for the efficacy of duloxetine in the treatment setting has been provided.",
        "Oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy (OIN) is a side effect of oxaliplatin chemotherapy treatment and the FDA has not approved a specific treatment for this condition. However, various clinical trials have investigated agents such as vitamin B12, B6, B1, calcium and magnesium infusions, and duloxetine. Based on the available literature, duloxetine 30 mg or 60 mg orally once daily appears to be the most effective drug.",
        "Amifostine is the most effective drug for oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy.",
        "The most effective drugs for treating oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy include pregabalin, duloxetine, and oxycodone, with mexiletine, omeprazole, and Calmangafodipir also showing effectiveness.",
        "There is currently no single \"most effective\" drug for oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy, as treatment options are often individualized based on the severity of symptoms and patient preferences. However, duloxetine and pregabalin are commonly used medications for managing neuropathic pain associated with oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy. Other treatments may include tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, or topical agents. Additionally, there is ongoing research into potential neuroprotective agents that may prevent or reduce the severity of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy.",
        "The most effective drug for oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy is donepezil. Donepezil has been shown to effectively attenuate oxaliplatin-induced inhibition of neurite outgrowth and ameliorate peripheral neuropathy in both in vitro and in vivo models. It does not inhibit the anti-tumor activity of oxaliplatin and may be useful for managing oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy.",
        "The most effective drugs for treating oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy are those that target specific mechanisms of nerve damage and pain perception, such as gabapentinoids (like gabapentin or pregabalin), which work by inhibiting voltage-dependent calcium channels to reduce the release of neurotransmitters involved in pain signaling. Other medications used include duloxetine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that has been shown to be effective for managing chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. Additionally, tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can also be used off-label for their analgesic effects in treating neuropathy. It is important to note that the choice of medication should be individualized based on a patient\u0027s specific symptoms, overall health status, and potential drug interactions.",
        "Amifostine at the dose of 25 mg/kg provided the best protection against oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy.",
        "There are several drugs that have been studied for their potential in treating oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy, including pregabalin, duloxetine, oxycodone, and riluzole. However, the most effective drug for oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy is still unknown, as different studies have shown varying results. A systematic review and meta-analysis of available studies would be necessary to determine the most effective drug for this condition.",
        "Based on the provided information, several drugs have shown potential in preventing or treating oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy in preclinical and clinical studies:\n\n1. Amifostine: Reduced nociception induced by oxaliplatin in mice, with 25 mg/kg providing the best protection.\n\n2. Rutin and Quercetin: Prevented painful peripheral neuropathy induced by oxaliplatin in mice. \n\n3. Ibudilast: Prevented the development of tactile allodynia and memory impairments caused by oxaliplatin in an animal study.\n\n4. Mangafodipir: Suggested to prevent and/or relieve oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy in cancer patients.\n\n5. Carbamazepine: Demonstrated prevention of oxaliplatin-induced sensory neuropathy greater than grade 1 in a clinical study.\n\nHowever, the information provided does not clearly indicate which drug is the most effective. More comparative clinical studies would be needed to determine the relative efficacy of these agents in preventing or treating oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy in humans.",
        "The most effective drug for oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy is currently not established. However, several drugs have shown potential in alleviating neuropathic symptoms. These include duloxetine, pregabalin, gabapentin, and amifostine. Further research is needed to determine the optimal treatment approach for oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy.",
        "Duloxetine is the best-established treatment for painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).",
        "Duloxetine is the most effective drug for oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy, according to a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2019. The review analyzed data from 11 randomized controlled trials involving 1,225 patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) caused by oxaliplatin. The study found that duloxetine significantly reduced the severity and incidence of CIPN compared to placebo or standard care. Other drugs that have shown some effectiveness in managing oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy include gabapentin, pregabalin, and amitriptyline, but duloxetine appears to be the most effective.",
        "Duloxetine, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is considered the best-established treatment for painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), including oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy.

However, it is important to note that the evidence is limited and further research is needed to fully establish its effectiveness.",
        "Currently, there is limited evidence for the efficacy of duloxetine in the treatment of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy. Duloxetine, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is the best-established treatment for painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). However, it is only effective in little more than half of patients, and our ability to predict patient response remains incompletely understood. Further research is needed to identify more effective treatments for oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy.",
        "The most effective drug for oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy is duloxetine, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Duloxetine has been shown to prevent and reverse mechanical hyperalgesia associated with oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in preclinical studies. However, its efficacy in clinical settings is limited, with only about 50% of patients responding to the treatment. The neuroendocrine stress axis-dependence of duloxetine analgesia has been demonstrated in preclinical models, suggesting that stress may impact response to duloxetine. Further research is needed to identify additional effective treatments for oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy.",

While studies have demonstrated comparable survival and recurrence rates between WW and radical surgery, the decision to undergo surgery has significant effects on patient quality of life. We sought to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing WW with abdominoperineal resection (APR) and low anterior resection (LAR) among patients with stage II/III rectal cancer.METHODS: In this comparative-effectiveness study, we built Markov microsimulation models to simulate disease progression, death, costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for WW or APR/LAR. We assessed cost effectiveness using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), with ICERs under $100,000/QALY considered cost effective. Probabilities of disease progression, death, and health utilities were extracted from published, peer-reviewed literature. We assessed costs from the payer perspective.RESULTS: WW dominated both LAR and APR at a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of $100,000. Our model was most sensitive to rates of distant recurrence and regrowth after WW. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that WW was the dominant strategy over both APR and LAR over 100% of iterations across a range of WTP thresholds from $0-250,000.CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests WW could reduce overall costs and increase effectiveness compared with either LAR or APR.

        "Using current multi-institutional recurrence estimates, we observed comparable cancer-specific survival, superior quality-adjusted survival, and decreased costs with Watch and Wait compared with upfront Total Mesorectal Excision.",
        "Yes, the watch-and-wait policy after neoadjuvant therapy is likely a cost-effective policy for locally advanced rectal cancer patients. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found that the watch-and-wait policy resulted in comparable oncologic outcomes and reduced costs compared to upfront total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery. The study included 292 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, and found that the mean costs per patient were significantly lower for the watch-and-wait subgroup (€6713) compared to the TME subgroup (€17,108) during a two-year follow-up period. Additionally, the study found that the overall survival rate was high in both groups, with no significant difference in metastasis-free survival or disease-free survival between the two groups. These findings suggest that the watch-and-wait policy can be a cost-effect",
        "Yes, a watch-and-wait policy after neoadjuvant therapy can be a cost-effective policy for locally advanced rectal cancer patients, as it can decrease costs related to unnecessary surgery.",
        "The watch-and-wait strategy after neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced rectal cancer has shown to offer similar oncological outcomes compared to surgery, along with excellent results in quality of life and cost outcomes, especially for low rectal cancer cases. This approach can be considered cost-effective for eligible patients, providing comparable outcomes while potentially avoiding the morbidity and costs associated with surgery.",
        "Yes, the watch-and-wait policy is a cost-effective approach",
        "Yes, the watch-and-wait (WW) policy after neoadjuvant therapy is a cost-effective policy for locally advanced rectal cancer patients, as it offers similar oncological outcomes to the surgical group and excellent results in quality of life and cost outcomes, especially for low rectal cancer.",
        "Yes, according to a cost-utility analysis using a Markov decision analytic model, the watch-and-wait policy (WW) after neoadjuvant therapy is a cost-effective policy for locally advanced rectal cancer patients. The study found that WW saves costs and provides better health outcomes, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of -75,486.75 € and an additional 2.04 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, when compared to standard resection (SR). The study also compared WW to robotic rectal resection (RRR) and found that WW dominates both SR and RRR in terms of cost and effectiveness. However, the study noted significant uncertainty due to the high utility value assigned to clinical complete response (cCR) after neoadjuvant therapy in the RRR alternative.",
        "Yes, Watch-and-wait policy after neoadjuvant therapy is a cost-effective policy for locally advanced rectal cancer patients with complete clinical response.",
        "Yes, the watch-and-wait policy is cost-effective for these patients.",
        "The \"watch and wait\" policy, also known as active surveillance or expectant management, is an emerging treatment strategy for selected patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who achieve a clinical complete response (cCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. While this approach avoids the morbidity associated with radical surgery, it is still under investigation and considered experimental by some medical institutions. The cost-effectiveness of watch and wait compared to standard surgical resection for LARC patients remains unclear. Some studies have suggested that watch and wait may be a cost-effective option due to shorter hospital stays, fewer complications, and better quality of life associated with avoiding major surgery. However, these findings are based on limited data and need further validation through larger prospective trials. Additionally, the long-term oncological outcomes and costs related to potential local recurrences or distant metastases in watch and wait patients require careful consideration.",
        "Watch-and-wait policy after neoadjuvant therapy may be a cost-effective policy for locally advanced rectal cancer patients, as it has been shown to offer comparable cancer-specific survival, superior quality-adjusted survival, and reduced cost compared with upfront surgery in some studies. However, more research is needed to confirm the clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of this approach compared with surgery in rectal cancer.",
        "Yes, according to some studies. A study published in the Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery found that the watch-and-wait (W\u0026W) policy after neoadjuvant therapy is a cost-effective policy for locally advanced rectal cancer patients, estimating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) to be gained from patients reaching a clinical complete response (cCR) to chemoradiotherapy. However, it\u0027s important to note that further researches on patient screening, strategy improvement, evaluation optimization, and risk control during implementation are necessary. Encouraging doctor-patient shared decision-making, adequate patient communication and informed consent, and careful design and practice of clinical research are also necessary.",
        "Yes, the watch-and-wait strategy in locally advanced rectal cancer offers similar oncological outcomes compared to the surgical group and excellent results in quality of life and cost outcomes, especially for low rectal cancer.",

        "Yes, the watch-and-wait policy after neoadjuvant therapy is considered a cost-effective strategy for locally advanced rectal cancer patients, as it has shown comparable cancer-specific survival, superior quality-adjusted survival, and decreased costs compared to upfront total mesorectal excision (TME) in cases where surgical salvage rates are low.",
        "Yes, the watch-and-wait (WW) policy after neoadjuvant therapy is a cost-effective policy for locally advanced rectal cancer patients. The findings indicate that WW leads to decreased costs while maintaining comparable cancer-specific survival and providing superior quality-adjusted survival compared to upfront total mesorectal excision (TME). Upfront TME tends to be preferred only when surgical salvage rates are low.",
        "Yes, the watch-and-wait policy is associated with superior quality-adjusted survival, comparable cancer-specific survival, and decreased costs for locally advanced rectal cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. However, upfront TME should be considered when surgical salvage rates are low.",
        "Yes, the watch-and-wait (WW) policy after neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced rectal cancer patients is generally cost-effective. It has been observed to offer comparable cancer-specific survival rates and superior quality-adjusted survival, along with decreased costs compared to immediate total mesorectal excision (TME). However, the preference for upfront TME might increase if the rates of successful surgical salvage are low",
        "yes, the watch-and-wait (WW) policy after neoadjuvant therapy is a cost-effective policy for locally advanced rectal cancer patients. According to the study, this approach not only shows comparable cancer-specific survival rates but also leads to superior quality-adjusted survival and decreased costs compared to upfront total mesorectal excision (TME). The text mentions, \"we observed comparable cancer-specific survival, superior quality-adjusted survival, and decreased costs with WW compared with upfront TME.\" This indicates that WW is a financially and medically viable option when surgical salvage rates are adequate.",
        "According to a study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, watch-and-wait (WW) policy after neoadjuvant therapy is a cost-effective policy for locally advanced rectal cancer patients. The study compared the costs and outcomes of watch-and-wait (WW) and upfront surgery (TME) for locally advanced rectal cancer patients. The study found that WW resulted in comparable cancer-specific survival, superior quality-adjusted survival, and decreased costs compared to upfront TME. However, upfront TME was preferred when surgical salvage rates were low. Overall, the study suggests that WW policy after neoadjuvant therapy is a cost-effective and clinically beneficial approach for locally advanced rectal cancer patients.",
        "Yes, the watch-and-wait (WW) policy after neoadjuvant therapy is a cost-effective policy for locally advanced rectal cancer patients. According to a decision-analytic model, the WW strategy offers comparable cancer-specific survival, superior quality-adjusted survival, and reduced costs compared to upfront total mesorectal excision (TME). In the study, WW was found to be dominant relative to both low anterior resection and abdominoperineal resection, with cost savings of $28,500 and $32,100 respectively. The incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) were also higher for the WW strategy. However, upfront TME was preferred when the rate of surgical salvage was low. These findings suggest that the WW policy can be a cost-effective alternative for locally advanced rectal cancer patients who have achieved a clinical complete response to neoadjuvant therapy.",
        "The Watch and Wait (WW) policy, which involves close surveillance without immediate surgical intervention following neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced rectal cancer, has been found to be comparable in terms of cancer-specific survival but offers superior quality-adjusted survival and lower costs compared to upfront Total Mesorectal Excision (TME). However, when the rate of successful surgical salvage after WW is low, upfront TME may become a more preferred option due to its higher success rate in achieving local control.",
        "The study suggests that a watch-and-wait (WW) policy after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is a cost-effective strategy for locally advanced rectal cancer patients. The WW approach offers comparable cancer-specific survival, superior quality-adjusted survival, and reduced costs compared to upfront total mesorectal excision (TME). In the base case analysis, WW resulted in cost savings of $28,500 and $32,100 compared to low anterior resection and abdominoperineal resection, respectively, along with improved quality-adjusted life-years. These findings were consistent across various sensitivity analyses. However, it is essential to note that WW remains a dominant strategy only if the rate of surgical salvage does not fall below 73%. Thus, the watch-and-wait policy after neoadjuvant therapy could be considered a cost-effective approach for managing locally advanced rectal cancer patients.",
        "Yes, based on the provided information, a watch-and-wait approach for locally advanced rectal cancer patients after neoadjuvant therapy was found to have comparable cancer-specific survival, superior quality-adjusted survival, and decreased costs compared to upfront total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery. However, upfront TME was preferred when surgical salvage rates were low.",

This approach has shown comparable cancer-specific survival, superior quality-adjusted survival, and decreased costs compared to upfront total mesorectal excision (TME). However, it is important to consider the surgical salvage rates when deciding between WW and upfront TME. If the surgical salvage rates are low, upfront TME may be preferred."

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may be used to rule out infectious etiologies, and an increase in BAL fluid eosinophils is suggestive of drug-induced toxicity. The acute reaction to nitrofurantoin is believed to be mediated by an immune mechanism.

Many adverse effects of nitrofurantoin have been documented, including aplastic anemia, polyneuritis, and liver and pulmonary toxicity.CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the clinical history and the autopsy findings in a 51-year-old woman with lung fibrosis of unknown etiology. She had a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, treated with nitrofurantoin for many years. She was referred to our hospital for screening for lung transplantation because of severe pulmonary restriction and dyspnea. Unfortunately, she died as a result of progressive respiratory insufficiency. At autopsy bilateral patchy, sharply circumscribed fibrotic areas in the upper and lower lobes of the lungs were seen with honeycombing. Microscopically, end-stage interstitial fibrosis with diffuse alveolar damage was observed. Due to the atypical distribution of the fibrosis involving both the lower and upper lobes of the lung, the microscopic pattern of the fibrosis and the history of long-term nitrofurantoin use, we concluded that this drug induced the lung fibrosis. The recurrent urinary tract infections were probably caused by a diverticulum of the urinary bladder, which was discovered at autopsy.CONCLUSION: This case shows that the use of nitrofurantoin may cause severe pulmonary disease. Patients with long-term use of nitrofurantoin should be monitor",

We describe an 82-year-old female medicated with nitrofurantoin for the previous 2 years who was admitted for dyspnoea, dry cough and fatigue for 4 months. She was febrile and tachypnoeic and she presented with bilateral basal crackles, hypoxaemic respiratory failure and slightly elevated C-reactive protein levels. A chest radiograph showed bilateral air-space consolidation and interstitial infiltrates and the high-resolution computed tomography scan was evocative of a perilobular pattern of organising pneumonia (OP). Due to the clinical-radiological context, she was diagnosed with a presumable nitrofurantoin-induced OP. She was started on prednisolone 60 mg daily with a progressive improvement. It is important that clinicians are aware of the spectrum of side effects associated with nitrofurantoin so as to monitor patients.LEARNING POINTS: It is crucial to ensure that a thorough medical history with a systems review and a complete drug history are carried out.Chronic pulmonary toxicity due to nitrofurantoin is rare and it occurs primarily in older women who have been prescribed relatively small doses of nitrofurantoin for UTI prevention.The cessation of nitrofurantoin is the basis of the treatment and may be sufficient for clinical and radiologi",

The majority of patients receiving targeted therapy or chemotherapy develop drug resistance, while its molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. The plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) exhibited the potential in identifying gene variations and monitoring drug resistance in CRC treatment. In this study, we monitored the ctDNA mutational changes in advanced CRC patients underwent first-line therapy with bevacizumab and cetuximab combined with chemotherapy. The mutation spectrum of 43 patients was established by a 605-gene next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel. The baseline measurement shows that genes with the highest mutation frequency were TP53 (74%), APC (58%), KRAS (40%), SYNE1 (33%), LRP1B (23%), TOP1 (23%), and PIK3CA (21%). Mutations in TP53, APC, and KRAS were detected in 29 paired plasma and tissue samples with the consistency of 81, 67, and 42%, respectively. Clinically targetable gene mutations, such as APC, RNF43, SMAD4, BRAD1, KRAS, RAF1, and TP53, were also identified in ctDNA. The overall consistency between ctDNA and tissue samples was 54.6%. Alleviation of mutational burden in BRAF, KRAS, AMER1, and other major driving genes was observed following the first-line therapy. Patients with KRAS and TP53 mutations in tissues appeared to benefit more than the wild-type counterpart.

The median age increased from 35.5 months in the earlier period to 80.5 months (P \u003d .007). Overall, H influenzae type b was identified as the causative organism in 76% of patients, but in only 25% of the cases since 1990 (P \u003d .004). Of the eight cases from 1990 through 1992, three had group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus isolated from a surface culture of the epiglottis; three other cases of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus were identified earlier. These patients were significantly older than those with H influenzae type b disease (117.5 vs 35 months, P \u003d .004). No important differences were found in any of a number of clinical characteristics based on causative organism or year of diagnosis.CONCLUSION: Acute epiglottitis has diminished in frequency since 1990. Patients whose conditions have been diagnosed since then tend to be older and to have disease caused by organisms other than H influenzae type b (particularly group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus).

The annual trend showed a significant decline in incidence among children, whereas in adults it remained unchanged.

It is caused by a GAA repeat expansion mutation within the frataxin gene (FXN). This impedes FXN transcription resulting in a progressive decrease of the mitochondrial protein, frataxin. Increased oxidative stress leading to a chronic depletion of endogenous antioxidants affects the survival of the cells and causes neurodegeneration. In particular, cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) show a significant increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and lower level of reduced glutathione (GSH). In FRDA, one of the major pathways of oxidant scavengers, the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, is defective. Previous studies on FRDA-like CGNs showed that the reduced level of frataxin and the oxidative stress induce mitochondrial impairments. By triggering the Nrf2 endogenous pathway pharmacologically we determined whether this could promote mitochondrial fitness and counteract oxidative stress. In this work, we sought to investigate the beneficial effect of a promising Nrf2-inducer, omaveloxolone (omav), in CGNs from two FRDA mouse models, KIKO and YG8R, and human fibroblasts from patients. We found that CGNs from both KIKO and YG8R presented Complex I deficiency and that omav was able to restore substrate availability and Complex I activity. This was also confirmed in human primary fibroblasts from FRDA patients. Although fibroblasts are not the major tissue affected, we found that they show significant differences recapitulating the disease; this is therefore an important tool to investigate patients\u0027 pathophysiology. Interestingly, we found that patient fibroblasts had an increased level",

There were a total of 982 cancers in 723 individuals. Colorectal cancer (CRC) was the commonest type (64% and 55% in individuals from families with germline MLH1 and MSH2 mutations respectively). Median age at diagnosis of first CRC in MSH6 mutation families was 59 years compared to 45 years in both MLH1 and MSH2 mutation families. The relative risk (RR) of endometrial cancer was 55 in MSH2 mutation families, compared with 27 in MLH1 mutation families, and 37 in MSH6 mutation families; median age at diagnosis 49 years. Even within MSH2 families, endometrial cancer tended to cluster, with 28 of the 58 cases coming from families with three or more cases (P \u003c 0.001). Absolute risk of endometrial cancer in MLH1 families was still greater than any other cancer (other than CRC). 5% of cancers in both MLH1 and MSH2 mutation families were gastric (RR \u003d 12); 53% of these were diagnosed before 50 years. Seven cases of small intestinal cancer occurred in MSH2 and MLH1 mutation families (RR \u003d 26). There were 13 cases of cancer of the ureter; all were in MSH2 families. These cancers tended to cluster within families (P \u003c 0.001); three of seven families with urothelial cancer had such cases in two or more individuals; two others had kidney cancer. Nineteen of 27 ovarian cancers (70%) were in MSH2 mutation families and 70% of these were diagnosed before age 50 years. There were 9 cases of sebaceous skin cancer, 3 in two MLH1 and 6 in four MSH2 mutation families. Of 22 pancreatic cancers, 14 were known to be diagnosed before 60 years.

These tumours are characterised by an underlying defect in DNA mismatch repair and exhibit numerous replication errors throughout the genome (RER+ phenotype). HNPCC-associated gastric tumours, and a subset of sporadic, distally-located gastric tumours exhibit this RER+ phenotype. It is recognised that proximal and distal gastric tumours exhibit distinct epidemiological features. In this study we investigated the occurrence of microsatellite instability in a series of 38 primary gastric adenocarcinomas, arising in the proximal stomach. A total of 138 microsatellite markers, comprising mainly dinucleotide and tetranucleotide repeat units and covering all autosomal arms, excluding acrocentric arms, were analysed. One tumour demonstrated somatic microsatellite alterations at 62% (26 of 42) of loci tested. A further 32 tumours demonstrated levels of microsatellite instability ranging from 0.8% (1 of 28)-11.4% (15 of 132) of loci tested. Five tumours demonstrated no microsatellite alterations at any of the loci tested. These findings suggest that a high percentage of proximal gastric carcinomas exhibit a low level of microsatellite alterations at dinucleotide and tetranucleotide repeat loci. However, ubiquitous somatic alterations at these loci, characteristic of HNPCC-associated tumours, occur in a relatively small proportion of tumours.",
